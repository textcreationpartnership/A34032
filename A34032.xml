            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHen first I thought of this Work, my Deſign was only to anſwer the moſt material Objections in Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi>'s Sermons; without offering any Reaſons or Arguments, to prove the Tenets which He impugns. But upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Thoughts, conſidering that the Weaker, and more Ignorant ſort of People, for whoſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe I chiefly deſign'd it, might be eaſily ſhaken in their Faith, by the ſpecious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of this Ingenious Man; and not a little ſtartled at his Pretence to Evidence of <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> against the Doctrine of R. Catholicks; and that perhaps they had not the leiſure, nor happily the will, to read over other Controverſies, where the ſaid Doctrine is largely prov'd: I judg'd it would contribute more to their ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſtrengthen them more effectually in their Faith, if I ſhou'd lay down ſome
<pb facs="tcp:103560:3"/>
of the Grounds on which their Belief is founded; than barely to ſolve the Objections, and refer them to other Books for the Proof of their Faith: Weak Capacities being commonly loth to take much pains; and, what is worſe, apt to forget what they read in one Place, before they join it to that which they read in another: Whereas a brief Account of their Faith, and ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations upon the Objections laid toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wou'd render the Task more eaſie, and the ſatisfaction more full.</p>
            <p>But what influenc'd me most to take that Method, was this: A certain R. Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Gentlewoman being very uneaſie with her Friends, upon account of Religion, was very much ſolicited by One, to whom ſhe had ſome ſpecial Obligations, to read Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi>'s Sermons, as the most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al means to make her ſee the Truth of the Proteſtant Religion, and the Errors of her own: And to engage her the more in the matter, he read ſome of the ſaid Sermons to her, and highly commended them; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding that nothing cou'd be more plain, than that ſhe was very much wanting to her own Interest, if ſhe ſhou'd refuſe to read thoſe Sermons, which (as he ſaid) made out as clear as the Day, that ſhe was in
<pb facs="tcp:103560:3"/>
an Error. Which when ſhe told me, and withall added, that ſhe ſhou'd be glad to have the Scruples, which theſe Sermons gave her, remov'd; and not a little pleas'd to find that her own Faith was founded in Scripture, and in the Authority of the Primitive Fathers, which it ſeems, ſhe had not taken pains to enquire into before: I promis'd her to contribute my Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to her ſatisfaction in both.</p>
            <p>And this, in a word, is what chiefly determin'd me to prefix the Proof of each Controverted Point to the Dr's Objections. How well I have ſucceeded in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, let others judge. This (with many other Defects) I am Conſcious of, that the apprehenſion of being too tedious, has made me contract my Arguments and Reaſons; and bring them within a narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Compaſs than the Rules of Diſcourſe will well allow of. My Bus'neſs it to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Weak, and Ignorant, not to pleaſe the Curious; and therefore, if I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd my Thoughts plain and eaſie, I am content. 'Tis the Fate of Great Volums ſcarce ever to be read all out, at least, by ſuch as moſt need them; and ſo, by multiplying of Reaſons and Arguments, and dilating upon them, the whole is made uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.
<pb facs="tcp:103560:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Whereas ſmall Treatiſes, of two or three days reading, are commonly perus'd by every body, upon this ſole Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that if the Advantage be not great, at leaſt the Labour is but little.</p>
            <p>For this Reaſon, in quoting the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I have multiply'd their Number, nor their Paſſages to that degree as might otherwiſe be expected. But to make A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends, I took ſpecial care to bring no one Paſſage, to which any Learned Proteſtant can justly except; being ſuch as the moſt Judicious Critics do acknowledge to be the Genuine Works of thoſe Fathers, in whoſe Names they are quoted. My Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages are, indeed, Small in Number, but Great in Authority. I judg'd, that five or ſix of the Fathers, the moſt Eminent for Piety and Learning, were ſufficient Witneſſes of the Faith of their Times; eſpecially when not contradicted by others. Theſe Great Men I look upon as ſo many Flameing Torches, ſet up to give Light to all future Ages. Their vaſt Learning and Knowledge in Sciences, eſpecially in the Law of God, is enough to perſwade any Man, that they cou'd not be ignorant of any the leaſt Point of their Faith; and their Piety and Zeal for God's Honor,
<pb facs="tcp:103560:4"/>
and His Holy Religion, ſets them above the ſuſpicion of even Malice it ſelf, of Writing, or Teaching, or Practiſing any thing that ſhou'd appear to be contrary to the Faith and Diſcipline of the Church; eſpecially, ſince their learned Works do ſtill demonſtrate how ſuddenly they were alarm'd at the leaſt Errors, or Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in theſe Matters, and how zealouſly they wrote againſt, and branded the Broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and Promoters of Novelty. So that we may confidently aſſert, That what theſe Fathers taught and believ'd, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the Catholic Faith; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce upon the ſtrength of their Reaſons and Authority, tho' we had no other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to prove it.</p>
            <p>As to Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi>'s Sermons, becauſe there are ſeveral Editions of them in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Sizes, it will be requiſite to let the Reader know what <hi>Edition</hi> and <hi>Size</hi> I make uſe of. I have all that has been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto publiſh'd of them, in Eight Volums, in a large Octavo; whereof, the two firſt are of the Eighth Edition; the third, of the Fourth; and all the reſt, of the Firſt Edition. But the Three Laſt being pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd by Dr. <hi>Barker,</hi> after the Deceaſe of the Author, are Mark'd on the Back, and
<pb facs="tcp:103560:5"/>
in the Title Page, 1ſt. 2d. 3d. <hi>Vol.</hi> which in my Citations I point at thus. <hi>Vol.</hi> 1ſt. 2d. or 3d. <hi>Edit. poſt Obit.</hi> to distinguiſh them from the Reſt, which are Cited with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Addition, only that of Volum and Page.</p>
            <p>Two things more ſeem to require I ſhou'd here ſpeak to, in order to beſpeak the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's Favour: The First, that it may ſeem to need ſome Apology, that in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the Books of an Arch Biſhop, I do not treat him with that Civility and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that is due to his Perſon and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. The Second, that it may ſeem ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hardy and bold for a R. Catholic to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in a Controverſie, which must needs offend many, eſpecially at this time of day, when the most Innocent of our Actions are lyable to ſiniſter Conſtructions: For it ſeems to carry a face of Raſhneſs and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to provoke our Superiours, when we know it is in their Power to cruſh and deſtroy us.</p>
            <p>To the First I Anſwer; That I have endeavour'd, (as far as the Nature of the Cauſe wou'd allow it) to keep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Compaſs of Civility and Reſpect; and wou'd have given no Man cauſe to complain, if his Conduct had not (as I conceive) extorted ſome hard Words from me. 'Tis true, no manner of Diſpute, or
<pb facs="tcp:103560:5"/>
Controverſie, can Justifie a Man's being Rude or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncivil; yet, I believe every one will allow, that it is not poſſible to manage a Controverſie of this Nature, and, at the ſame Time, to ſhew the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that might be expected upon other Occaſions, without betraying the Cauſe. I have, indeed, on purpoſe, forborn to give him any other <hi>Title</hi> than that of <hi>Doctor;</hi> becauſe my Diſpute with him is not, as he was an Arch-Biſhop, but as a Dr. of Divinity; and becauſe I conceiv'd, I might with leſs Diſreſpect uſe the neceſſary freedom of ſpeech un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Notion. However, if any of my Readers will pleaſe to do me the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to let me know wherein I have unneceſſarily exceeded the Limits of due Moderation, I ſhall take it very kindly, and endeavour to make amends for my Fault.</p>
            <p>To the Second; That I never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to provoke or exaſperate any Man; much leſs wou'd I provoke any of the worthy Members of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> whom I am in Duty bound to Honor and Reſpect: And if I wrote any thing that looks that way, 'twas the neceſſity of the Subject, not my Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that forc'd me upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103560:6"/>My Deſign was only to lay before thoſe of my own Perſwaſion, the Truth of that Doctrine, which they, and their Anceſtors, have believ'd ſince Christianity was plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among Them; and which I ſee now they have many Temptations to quit: And in this, I think, I do but follow the Example of the Apostles and Primitive Fathers, who, in the greateſt Heat of Perſecutions and Fiery Tryals, (as the Scripture phraſes it) took more care than ever, to inculcate to the Christians the Truth of their Religion; and to Arm them with the Hopes of a future Life, that they might, the better, be able to bear up againſt the Temptations, and Rage of the World; and ſuffer with Joy, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, the Pillage and Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their Goods. <hi>Rapinam bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum veſtrorum cum gaudio ſuſcepiſtis.</hi> However, if I have ſin'd on that hand, I have that confidence in the Equity and Goodneſs of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that my Fault, which is peculiar to my ſelf, will not be requir'd at the hands of Thoſe of my Perſwaſion, whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or Approbation I never deſir'd.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant, That our Lives, and Fortunes, are at the Mercy of the
<pb facs="tcp:103560:6"/>
Law, and may be depriv'd of Both, when it ſhall pleaſe our Magistrates to put them in Execution: But ſuch is their Lenity and Goodneſs, that they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlook us, and ſuffer us to live; <hi>which we accept always, and in all places, and with all Thankfulneſs;</hi> and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly beſeech Almighty God to bleſs and proſper them for it.</p>
            <p>The Better Sort, (which, bleſſed be God, are alſo the Greater) are ſenſible, that our only Crime is our Conſcience, which we cannot help; and which, I truſt in God, we ſhall ever prefer to all that is moſt dear to us in this World. They deſire our Converſion, becauſe they think us in an Error; and we likewiſe deſire, and earnestly pray for their's, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are perſwaded they are in the wrong. They know we have made no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations in Religion, nor broach'd any New Doctrines; but only ſtick to, <hi>and</hi> (to uſe St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Words) <hi>hold faſt the Profeſſion of that Faith,</hi> which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from our, and their Ancestors: A Plea which ſecur'd the very Pagans in the Poſſeſſion of their Lives and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, when the Chriſtians got the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them; and which, I trust in God,
<pb facs="tcp:103560:7"/>
and in the Goodneſs of our Governours, will ever ſecure us.</p>
            <p>We are not therefore inſenſible of the Clemency and Good Nature of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Men of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor are we ſo dull as not to take notice of the Connivance and Liberty they are pleas'd to allow us; but we think we cannot make them a more ſuitable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, (<hi>a</hi> more charitable I am ſure we cannot) than to lay before them the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Conſequences of their Errors, and the deſperate State of their Souls. We ſee the horrid Sacrileges committed by their Anceſtors, and the <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie</hi> into which they fell; and we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it our Duty to them, (who, tho' they ſhou'd uſe us never ſo ill, are ſtill our Brethren) to mind them of the great Danger and Hazard they run, in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Steps of their Fore-Fathers; and in perſiſting in thoſe Things, which we conceive are very great Impieties. And if, in handling theſe Matters, we are forc'd to uſe ſuch Expreſſions, as may ſeem to give Offence; 'tis the Neceſſity of the Subject, not our Inclination, that extorts them from us.

               <head>The Introduction.</head>
               <p>IT is commonly ſaid, and our own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teacheth it us, that good Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage goes far in gaining Credit to whatever is ſaid; and that a ſmooth poliſh'd Diſcourſe, when Gravely delivered, ſeems to carry the Face of Truth, though it ſhould happen to be otherwiſe. Words, when handſomely laid together, have I know not what of Charming in them, and do challenge the Attention of the moſt obſtinate, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when deliver'd by a Man in a High Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This, with ſome other Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, moved me to examine the Sermons of Doctor <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> late Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury;</hi> to ſee if the intrinſick Value of his

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ous Man has taken a great deal of Pains to convince the World of his Skill in Controverſie, and has delivered his Thoughts in ſuch fine ſmooth Language, that, in my Opinion, very few of his Brethren can equal him in the Elegancy of his Stile. We have eight Volumns in 8vo. of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, in which he ſeems to have exhauſted the Treaſure of his Eloquence, in comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the moſt eſſential Points controverted betwixt Catholics and Proteſtants; <hi>viz. The Infallibility of the Church, the Pope's Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, Tranſubſtantiation, Communion in one kind, Prayers in an unknown Tongue,</hi> as he is pleaſed to call it; <hi>Invocation of Saints, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Images,</hi> (his own words) <hi>Purgatory, and Indulgences.</hi> Tho' this be not the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I find he obſerves in handling theſe Points, but treats of 'em a little confuſedly, as ſuited beſt with his Texts; yet, for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod Sake, I choſe to lay 'em down in this order, being, as I ſuppoſe, the more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to treat of the moſt material Points, before I come to thoſe that ſeem to be of leſs Importance. In the handling then of this important Piece of Controverſie, I ſhall, with God's Aſſiſtance, obſerve this Method.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I will lay down what the Roman Catholics believe, as of Faith, concerning theſe Points.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I will prove their Tenets with Reaſon, Scripture, and Authority of Fathers;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103560:9"/>
tho' of this there ſhould ſeem little need, conſidering that it has been ſo often alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy done; were it not that my Buſineſs is with the ſimple and ignorant, whom I would willingly inſtruct in the Grounds of their own Faith, as well as to caution them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Subtilities of their Adverſaries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I will anſwer all the material Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, which Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> brings againſt the ſaid Tenets; and do faithfully promiſe, that where I do not quote his own words, (for that I cannot always do, by reaſon they are in many places very long) I ſhall not extenuate nor diminiſh, to the beſt of my Knowledge, the Force of his Arguments; nor wreſt his Words to any other Senſe, than what they naturally bear in any other Man's Mouth, or Writings.</p>
               <p>But before I begin, it will not be amiſs to lay down the Foundation on which this Ingenuous Man builds his Controverſie; a Foundation, indeed, whoſe Superſtructure had it been ſo true and ſolid, as it is arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially contrived, would in a great meaſure juſtifie the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and all other Proteſtant's Separation from their ancient Brethren, and ſilence the R. Catholics from faſtning the Imputation of Schiſm and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie upon them. But how far this is from what it ſeems to be, let the Reader judge when the Mask is taken off.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi>'s Fundamental Principle then is this. <q>Whatever is plain and evident to our <hi>Senſes</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> is to be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, tho' all the Churches and Men in the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103560:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
World ſhould perſwade us to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</q> Thus far, I own, he is in the right; but what he infers from thence, namely, that this is the Proteſtants Caſe in regard of the Papiſts, (as he is pleaſed to call the R. Catholicks) requires ſomething more than Herculean Labours to prove. He owns, indeed, (and that for Reaſons well known to the World) that in things doubtful and obſcure, every private Man ought to hear the Church, and receive her Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but in things that are plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, nay, as evident, as that twice two make four; I wou'd ſtand alone, ſays he, againſt all the World: His own Words are thus, as I find them in the fifth Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of his Sermons, <hi>pag.</hi> 16.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>In all matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practiſe,</hi> which are <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>evident,</hi> either from <hi>Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> or from <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution ſeems to be very reaſonable: But in things <hi>doubtful,</hi> a modeſt Man (and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man hath Reaſon to be ſo) would be apt to be ſtaggered by the Judgement of a very Wiſe Man; and much more of many ſuch, and eſpecially by the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Judgement of the Generality of Men.</p>
                  <p>But in things plainly contrary to the evidence of <hi>Senſe</hi> or <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or the <hi>Word of God,</hi> a Man would complement no Man, or Number of Men; nor would he pin his Faith upon any <hi>Church</hi> in the World; much leſs upon any ſingle Man, no not the Pope; no, tho' there were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103560:10"/>
ſo many probable Arguments brought for the Proof of his <hi>Infallibility.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this Caſe, a Man wou'd be ſingular, and ſtand alone againſt the whole World; againſt the Wrath and Rage of a King, and all the Terrours of his fiery <hi>Furnace;</hi> as in other matters, a Man wou'd not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all the Learned Men in the World againſt the clear Evidence of <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon.</hi> If all the great <hi>Mathematicians</hi> of all Ages, <hi>Archimedes,</hi> and <hi>Euclid,</hi> and <hi>Apollonius</hi> and <hi>Diophantus,</hi> &amp;c. could be ſuppoſed to meet together in a General Council, and ſhould there declare in the moſt ſolemn manner, and give it under their Hands and Seals, that twice two did not make four but five; this would not move me in the leaſt to be of their mind; nay, I who am no <hi>Mathematician,</hi> wou'd maintain the contrary, and wou'd perſiſt in it, without being in the leaſt ſtartled by the poſitive Opinion of theſe Learned Men; and wou'd moſt certainly conclude that they were either all of them out of their Wits, or that they were by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed by ſome <hi>Intereſt</hi> or other, and ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the clear <hi>Evidence</hi> of Truth, and the full Conviction of their own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to make ſuch a Determination as this. They might, indeed, over-rule the point by their Authority; but in my inward Judgement, I ſhould ſtill be where I was before.</p>
                  <p>Juſt ſo in Matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> if any <hi>Church,</hi> tho' with never ſo glorious a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103560:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
pretence to <hi>Infallibility,</hi> ſhould declare for <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> that is, that the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> by virtue of the Conſecration of the Prieſt, are <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially</hi> changed into the natural <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt; this is ſo notoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary both to the <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> of Mankind, that a Man would chuſe to ſtand ſingle in the oppoſition of it, and laugh at, or rather pity the reſt of the World that could be ſo ſervilely blind, as ſeeming to conſpire in the Belief of ſo <hi>monſtrous</hi> an <hi>Abſurdity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in like manner, if any Church ſhould declare that <hi>Images</hi> are to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped; or that the Worſhip of God is to be performed in an <hi>unknown Tongue;</hi> and that the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Word, and Will of God, and teaches Men what they are to believe and do in order to their eternal Salvation, are to be lock'd up and kept concealed from the People in a Language which they do not underſtand, leſt, if they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the free uſe of them, in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tongue, they ſhould know more of the Mind and Will of God, than is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for the common people to know, whoſe <hi>Devotion</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to the Church does chiefly depend upon their <hi>Ignorance:</hi> Or ſhould declare that the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not offer'd once for all, but is and ought to be repeated ten millions of times every day; and that the people ought to receive the Communion in one
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103560:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
kind only, and the Cup by no means to be truſted with them, for fear the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane <hi>Beards</hi> of the Laity ſhould drink of it; and that the ſaving Efficacy of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi> doth depend upon the Intention of the Prieſt, without which the <hi>Receiver</hi> can have no Benefit by them: Theſe are all of them ſo plainly contrary to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and moſt of them in reaſon ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, that the <hi>Authority</hi> of no Church whatſoever can oblige a Man to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of them. Thus far the Dr.</p>

               <p>Here you ſee, <hi>Chriſtian Reader,</hi> a Great Orator and Divine, teaching from the <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit</hi> and <hi>Preſs,</hi> that <hi>Senſe, Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> are all on the Proteſtant's ſide in the aforeſaid controverted Points, as <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>evident</hi> as that <hi>twice two make four.</hi> Here you ſee him arraign all the <hi>Patriacks, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mats, Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Doctors, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities,</hi> and even all <hi>Kings, Princes, Peers, Magiſtrates,</hi> together with the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all <hi>Countries</hi> and <hi>Provinces</hi> of the <hi>West;</hi> as alſo the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> and all the Countries and Provinces in <hi>Communion</hi> with it; all theſe Learned and Pious Chriſtians, I ſay that flouriſht in, and Governed this part of the World, when <hi>Martin Luther</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the <hi>Theatre,</hi> this worthy Man ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns for Fools and Madmen; I ſay, for Fools and Madmen; for all theſe <hi>Patriarchs, Primats, Kings, Princes,</hi> &amp;c. profeſſed, in thoſe days, to be guided by their <hi>Senſes,</hi> by <hi>natural</hi> Reaſon, and by the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> contained in the <hi>Holy Scriptures;</hi> and yet
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103560:12"/>
all of them believed the very ſame, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaid Points, the R. Catholics do now. Surely then, they muſt have been all Fools and Madmen, if Senſe, Reaſon and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be as <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>evident</hi> on the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant's ſide, as that <hi>twice two make four.</hi> For, who ever in his wits denied, that <hi>twice two</hi> do <hi>make four?</hi> Or in his right <hi>Senſes,</hi> ever affirmed, that white was black, or black white? Or that any of our <hi>Senſes,</hi> when they are perfect, do not give irrefragable Teſtimony of their proper Objects? Or that plain and evident Texts of Scripture were not to be believed? Theſe monſtrous Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities the Dr. faſtens upon all the Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and learned Men of the Eaſtern and Weſtern Churches, which flouriſht not only when <hi>Martin Luther</hi> roſe up, but alſo, by his own Acknowledgement, for, at leaſt, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ages before him; which is in effect to Brand them all with the Ignominious Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Fools and Madmen.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>If all the great <hi>Mathematicians</hi> of all Ages, ſaith the Dr. could be ſuppoſed to meet together in a General Council, and there declare in the moſt ſolemn manner, that <hi>twice two</hi> did not make <hi>four</hi> but <hi>five,</hi> I ſhould moſt certainly conclude that they were either all of them out of their Wits, or byaſſed by ſome <hi>Intereſt</hi> or other.</q> But good God! What ſhould byaſs any Man in his Wits, much leſs any <hi>Society</hi> of learned Men to declare againſt a thing ſo <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>evident?</hi> Nothing ſurely leſs than <hi>Phrenſy</hi> or <hi>Madneſs.</hi> But let us hear the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103560:12"/>
Application. <q>Juſt ſo in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, (continues the Dr.) if any Church ſhou'd declare for <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> that is, that the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> by virtue of the Conſecration of the Prieſt, are <hi>Subſtantially</hi> changed into the Body and Blood of Chriſt; this is ſo notoriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary both to the <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that a Man would chuſe to ſtand ſingle in the oppoſition, and laugh at, or rather pity the reſt of the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> The Dr. knew very well, and ſo do all the learned Proteſtants in the World, that the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek Churches,</hi> and all in <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> with them, have not only declared for, but have always believed, at leaſt, for ſeveral Ages, <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid: If it be then ſo notoriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary both to the <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as the Dr. would ſuggeſt; all thoſe Men, whereof a great number had, at leaſt, the Reputation of being both Learned and Virtuous, muſt neceſſarily have been all of them out of their wits, or byaſſed by ſome prejudice, which moſt certainly cou'd be nothing elſe, but the extremity of Madneſs and Folly, their eternal Damnation being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily conſequent upon ſuch a Belief. He purſues the ſame compariſon, inſtancing in the reſt of the Controverted Points afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
               <p>But what Man in his right <hi>Senſes</hi> would believe, that any one Nation, much leſs all <hi>Europe</hi> ſhould conſpire to renounce all thoſe means, which God has given them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103560:13"/>
the Knowledge of things, <hi>viz. Senſe, Reaſon,</hi> and the <hi>Word of God,</hi> without which it is impoſſible to know any thing; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in a matter which ſo highly concerns them: Or who wou'd not rather believe, that Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> was mightily miſtaken, than that the beſt part of Mankind ſhould make Shipwrack of that which alone diſtinguiſhes them from Beaſts? nay, who would not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe, that either he himſelf had been out of his Wits? Or that he deſigned to impoſe upon Mankind ſo ſtrange a paradox, as that hundreds of millions of Learned and Ingenious Men ſhould conſpire to declare againſt that which is, both their everlaſting <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and conſtitutes them Men; ſince neither he nor any Man elſe, cou'd ever inſtance in one ſingle Man in his wits, that ever was guilty of ſuch a Folly.</p>
               <p>This, I muſt confeſs, is one of the moſt ſurprizing, nay the moſt intollerable Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that ever was laid to Mankind; and yet how monſtrous and abſurd ſoever it appears, 'tis no leſs than what was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to ſupport the Cauſe the Dr. had undertaken. He was it ſeems, well read in that famous Diſpute betwixt Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and Mr. <hi>Serjeant</hi> concerning <hi>Schiſm.</hi> The former wrote a Book in Vindication of the Church of <hi>England</hi> from the Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Schiſm, which the R. Catholics charge her with: The latter anſwers his Book in an other, entituled, <hi>Schiſm diſarmed:</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> writes a <hi>Reply</hi> to this, and Mr. <hi>Serjeant</hi> adds a <hi>Rejoinder</hi> to that, which he calls <hi>Schiſm diſpatcht.</hi>

                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:103560:13"/>Now to know what relates to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in this Diſpute, you muſt underſtand, that Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in the firſt Chapter of his <hi>Defence of the Church of England,</hi> in his Deſcription of Schiſm, paints it in its own horrid and dreadful Shape; as the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> had done before him, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That it is Carnality, Self-condemning, contrary to Charity, bereaving one of the benefit, both of Prayers and Sacraments; as bad as, and the Foundation of all Hereſies; that there is ſcarce any Crime ſo great as Schiſm, not Sacriledge, Idolatry, Parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, that it is obnoxious to peculiar Marks of God's Indignation, Antichriſtianiſm, worſhipping or ſerving the Devil, not expiable by Martyrdom, very hard, if not impoſſible to receive ſuch an Injury or Provocation from the Governours of the Church, as may make a Separation excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable; impoſſible, according to St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that there ſhould be any juſt cauſe for any to ſeparate from the Church truly Catholic.</q> Thus far the Dr. and, indeed, very right, only where the Fathers condemn him and his party; he is ſo much a Friend to his Cauſe, as to alter the Phraſe a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: For inſtance, whereas St. <hi>Ireneus</hi> ſays abſolutely, <hi>It is impoſſible to receive ſuch an Injury or Provocation from the Governours of the Church, as to make a Separation excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> he ſaw very well, that if no kind of Injury or Provocation cou'd juſtifie a Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, himſelf and his Party ſtood condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103560:14"/>
in that Holy Fathers Opinion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he changed the word <hi>Impoſſible,</hi> into <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard, if not impoſſible;</hi> tho' in the Greek, (which ſome will have to be the original) or Latin Tranſlation, there is not the leaſt colour for it. So, where St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>That it is impoſſible there ſhould be any juſt Cauſe for any to ſeparate from the Catholic Church;</hi> He ſoftens the Expreſſion, changing, <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> into, the <hi>Church truly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic;</hi> pretending, if I may preſume to ſpell his meaning, that they did not ſeparate from the Church truly Catholic, tho' they had ſeparated from all other Societies and Congregations in the World; upon a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Pretence, as if the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> and the <hi>Church truly Catholic</hi> were two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things; or where the Expreſſion ſeems too harſh, he thinks himſelf ſufficiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled to moderate it; as, where the Holy Father St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays, <hi>There is no Crime ſo great as Schiſm;</hi> he makes bold with his Words rendring them thus; <hi>there is ſcarce any Crime ſo great as Schiſm.</hi>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Serjeant,</hi> to whoſe great <hi>Wit,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable Labour we are obliged for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Learned and Ingenious Works, in theſe two excellent <hi>Treatiſes,</hi> preſſes his <hi>Antagoniſt</hi> to purge himſelf and his party of the guilt of <hi>Schiſm;</hi> ſince he owns they had made a ſeparation from that Church, in whoſe communion they, and their <hi>Anceſtors</hi> were, ſince they imbraced the Chriſtian Faith. But among other preſſing <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> he urges this, which in my opinion
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103560:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is enough to open any man's eyes that has not ſworn never to ſee the <hi>Sun.</hi> Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> gathers from <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Scripture,</hi> that <hi>Schiſm</hi> is ſo horrid a ſin, that <q>there is ſcarce any crime (I give you his own words) ſo great, not Sacriledg, Idolatry, parricide; not expiable by Martyrdom; very hard, if not impoſſible to receive ſuch an injury or provocation from the Church, as may make a ſeparation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeable. Impoſſible according to St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin,</hi> that there ſhou'd be any juſt cauſe for any to ſeparate from the Church tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Catholic;</q> whence Mr. <hi>Serjeant</hi> reaſons thus: No Man in his Wits, much leſs any body of Learned Men ought to ſeparate from the Church, or withdraw themſelves from its Authority, unleſs they had a clear and evident Conviction, both that this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> abſolutely neceſſary, and that the Authority pretended by the Church, was a manifeſt uſurpation; becauſe they would elſe incur that horrid guilt of Schiſm: But Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and his Party are ſo far from having any ſuch Evidence or Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for either the one or the other, that nothing is pretended but bare probabilities and conjectures: Conſequently, it is the laſt of madneſs and folly in Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and his Party to perſiſt in their Separation. Now, Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> who was a very acute Man, foreſeeing what effect ſo plain a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſtration was like to have upon ſuch as tendered the Salvation of their Souls; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing however reſolved to maintain the Cauſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103560:15"/>
at any rate, cou'd bethink himſelf of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſufficient to juſtifie ſo dangerous a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, leſs than a clear and evident De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the neceſſity of it: And this, in my opinion, was the Reaſon why he undertook to demonſtrate that, in regard of the aforeſaid controverted Points, the common ſenſe of Man-kind, natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the Scripture, were as clear and evident on the <hi>Proteſtant's</hi> ſide, as that <hi>twice two make four.</hi> But what if I ſhew that he is ſo far from having any ſuch <hi>Evidence</hi> on his ſide, that there is not one of all theſe Points in which he inſtances, but what is deſtitute of even the leaſt probable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſupport it? Nay, I go farther, what if I demonſtrate that the R. Catholics have all the <hi>Evidence</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> that the nature of ſuch things will bear, for what they hold concerning theſe Points? Then ſurely I may reaſonably hope, that Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Men, who ought to tender the welfare of their Immortal Souls, will be ſo juſt to themſelves, as ſeriouſly to conſider, into what horrible and dangerous crimes they are drawn by the wilfulneſs of Men, who are reſolved to maintain a Separation, which all the world knows, was begun for no other end than to countenance Things that I am unwilling to name, but are too well known to be concealed.</p>
               <p>This I ſhall endeavour, by the aſſiſtance of God's Grace, to perform in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapters; when I have firſt laid down
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103560:15"/>
that chief and fundamental Point of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, namely the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the Church.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the Infallibility of the Church.</head>
                  <p>THE R. Catholics hold, <hi>that the Church is infallible, that is, cannot err in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Doctrine ſhe received from Jeſus Chriſt, nor miſtake in her Explanation thereof, when by</hi> Heretics <hi>wreſted and perverted to a wrong ſenſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ground of which <hi>Tenet</hi> I conceive to be this; that <hi>Chriſt</hi> has provided ſuch effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious means for the conveyance of Truth to all ſucceding Ages, as will infallibly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Church from error in her Decrees concerning Articles of Faith.</p>
                  <p>This Point is to be managed with ſo much the more perſpicuity and clearneſs, by how much it is of greater importance than any other: It will be therefore requiſite to take ſome pains to ſatisfie Mens Reaſons, and, if it be poſſible, to make this Truth ſo <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>evident,</hi> that thoſe whoſe Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and Prejudices make them unwilling to own it, may, at leaſt, be aſhamed to deny it: And methinks I have this peculiar advantage in this undertaking, that every Pious Chriſtian, who tenders the welfare of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103560:16"/>
his Soul, cannot chuſe but wiſh me ſucceſs; becauſe I undertake the Proof of that which it is every Man's Intereſt, it ſhou'd be true; for, if I can ſhew that there is an <hi>Infallible Church,</hi> and that ſuch a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Faithful is that Church, then all Chriſtians, who are Solicitous about the true Church, and the means of Salvation, and agitated with various Scruples and Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and which is more dreadful, threatned with Hell and Damnation by the furious Zeal of different Parties, may ſit ſtill, and hear what the <hi>Infallible Church</hi> ſays to them. In the handling then of this important Truth, I ſhall do theſe three Things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>I will endeavour to ſhew, that there is a Church, or Congregation of Faithful, which is Infallible in her Deciſions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of all Articles of Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That this Congregation, and no other, is that which is in Communion with the Biſhop of</hi> Rome.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>I ſhall anſwer the Objections which</hi> Dr. <hi>Tillotſon brings in his Sermons againſt this Point.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>I will endeavour to ſhew, that there is a Church, or Congregation of Faithful, which is Infallible in her Deciſions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of all Articles of Faith.</hi> To prove this, I ſhall lay down theſe Grounds.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Jeſus Chriſt planted his Doctrine in the Hearts of a certain number of Men, by working True and Real Miracles in their preſence, which no other but an Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Power cou'd effect; and that in order
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103560:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the propagating of this Doctrine, he choſe twelve Men, whom he called Apoſtles, and made them his chief Miniſters, veſting in them his own Power and Authority for that End.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That theſe twelve Apoſtles, and other Diſciples went into ſeveral Countries, and preached the ſame Doctrine to Jews and Gentiles, confirming it with true and real Miracles.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the Apoſtles ordained and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted other Miniſters of this Doctrine to ſucceed in their own Room, to whom they delegated the ſame Power they received from Jeſus Chriſt; and Theſe, Others; and ſo on from Generation to Generation, to continue to the end of the World.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That this Power of working Miracles continued in the Preachers of this Doctrine, at leaſt, till a conſiderable number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had embraced the ſame Doctrine in moſt of the then known Countries of <hi>Aſia, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and <hi>Africa:</hi> This ſuppoſed, I ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the people who heard the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles preach, and ſaw them confirm their Doctrine with true and real Miracles, were infallibly ſure, that this Doctrine was True; becauſe they were ſure the doing of ſuch Miracles required an Omnipotent Power, and that, according to the Notion all Men natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally have of God, he would not exert his Omnipotence in Favour of a Lye.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That, whatever Articles the Univerſal Conſent of ſo many Nations was agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to have been received from the Apoſtles,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103560:17"/>
it is impoſſible it ſhould be falſe, that they had received them; becauſe it is impoſſible, that ſo many Nations of different Intereſts, Tongues and Manners, ſhould all conſpire and agree to relate the ſame thing, as receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Apoſtles, if it had not been ſo. And as this is moſt aſſuredly true in regard of thoſe, who ſaw the Miracles of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and delivered their Doctrine to the next Generation; ſo it is, for the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, equally impoſſible it ſhould be falſe in reſpect of any ſucceeding Generation.</p>
                  <p>That there was ſuch a Man in <hi>England,</hi> as King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII; or that there is, or was, ſuch a Man as the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> or ſuch a City as <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> I am as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſure, as of any thing I ſee with my Eyes; for, it is as evident to my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that it is impoſſible in practice, that ſo many Nations, (as relate theſe things) different in their Humours, Manners and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, ſhould all conſpire to tell an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, which can be of no Advantage to them, as it is evident to my <hi>Senſes,</hi> that I ſee the Paper, and feel the Pen wherewith I write. For, ſince no Cauſe imaginable can be aſſigned, to cauſe ſo many different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to conſpire together in the Belief of an Untruth, (no intereſt, as we ſuppoſe, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them thereunto) and no Cauſe put, it is impoſſible an Effect ſhould follow, it is as evident to my Reaſon that they cannot thus conſpire, as it is to my Senſes, that I perceive their proper Objects; unleſs we have recourſe to God Almighty, and ſay,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103560:17"/>
that he might put it in their Hearts to act thus: But if we ſhould ſuppoſe this not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with his Divine Attributes; may we not likewiſe ſuppoſe that he might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon my Senſes, and make me think I ſee and feel when I do not? Yes undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Yet, I ſuppoſe, no Body will ſay, but that I may be certainly ſure, that I both ſee and feel. And whatever reaſon his unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Wiſdom might have to impoſe upon my <hi>Senſes,</hi> I am ſure it does not ſtand with his Goodneſs to put into any Man's Heart to tell a Lye. If it be then impoſſible, that the univerſal Conſent of all the Nations in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> ſhould be liable to err in delivering to poſterity things of an indifferent Nature; how much more muſt the Univerſal Conſent of all the Chriſtian World be certain in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying the Truth of the Goſpel upon which our eternal Welfare depends?</p>
                  <p>One ſingle Man may, and has often decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Truths that were committed to him; but becauſe he is obnoxious to <hi>Error,</hi> no Man is bound to believe him any further than he ſhews good <hi>Credentials</hi> for what he ſays. It was therefore neceſſary the Apoſtles and other Diſciples, who firſt preached the Goſpel, each apart, ſhould be endued with a power of working Miracles to gain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves credit. A ſmall Body of Men, ſuch as a City or Corporation, is leſs obnoxious to Error than one Man; however no Man is obliged to believe them, no further than they ſhew good Reaſon for what they ſay; becauſe it is eaſy for ſuch a Body of Men,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103560:18"/>
for ſome private End to conſpire in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of an Untruth. Thus in ſome time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Flood, the Son of <hi>Cham</hi> erected Idols, and perſwaded the reſt of their Kindred, (Men ſimple indeed, but very much abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God) that theſe were the Gods they muſt adore. And for all this falſe Worſhip prevailed in ſucceding Ages as Men increaſed, ſo as to ſpread almoſt over the whole Earth: Yet becauſe it was not only deſtitute of all Rational Motives to perſwade its Belief in the beginning, but even contrary to the Light of Nature, the very Philoſophers and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, that ſeem'd to promote its Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, gave no Credit to it. Thus a ſmall number of <hi>Sarazens</hi> perſwaded the reſt of their Rude and Barbarous Countrymen to believe the Impoſtures of <hi>Mahomet:</hi> And however this Barbarous Nation forced their Paſſage with Fire and Sword thro' many ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Countries, and planted their Religion in moſt parts of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Affrica.</hi> Tho' their Principles be not altogether ſo abſurd as thoſe of the Pagans, yet as they have not the leaſt Rational Motive to induce any Man to believe them; ſo neither were they obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the Believers (the Progeny of thoſe who firſt embraced them excepted) by any other means than Cruelty and Slaughter. I have on purpoſe mentioned theſe two falſe Religions, that ſwayed in the World for a long time, to obviate an Objection which might be made againſt the Unanimous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Chriſtians in their Belief of the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt. For, if it be ſaid,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103560:18"/>
that ſeveral Countries and Nations of <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Mahometans</hi> have conſpired in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Faith they received from their Anceſtors, yet that this Faith or Religion was falſe: This Objection is ſo far from impairing the Truth of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it rather confirms it: For it is moſt certain, the <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Mahometans</hi> receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Religion from their Anceſtors, and theſe from others, and that the miſtake did not conſiſt in this; but becauſe they were ſo fooliſh as to receive it from thoſe who took it up in the beginning, without any Rational Motive, nay contrary to Senſe and Reaſon, and the very Light of Nature. The Caſe was very different with the firſt Chriſtians: They embraced their Religion upon a <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>evident</hi> Conviction of their <hi>Senſes</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding; viz.</hi> upon the <hi>evidence</hi> of true and real Miracles, and other Corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating Proofs: But of this enough.</p>
                  <p>A whole Nation is much leſs ſubject to err, in conveying Truths received to Poſterity, than a City, or ſmall Body of People: And tho' it be not impoſſible they ſhould all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree together, to deliver to Poſterity what they had not received from their Anceſtors, yet it is hardly credible they would. That there hapned a great Conflagration in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> in the Year 66. we have no other Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but the Teſtimony of the People of <hi>England;</hi> yet, whoever ſhould deny that Fact, would be looked upon as a Fool, or a Madman. If it be then ſo incredible, that one Nation, who ſpeak all the ſame Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103560:19"/>
and have daily entercourſe one with an other, ſhould be ſo diſingenuous as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver to their Poſterity as a Truth received from their Anceſtors, what they had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; how ſhould it ever ſink into the Heart of any Man in his wits, to believe that Hundreds of Nations of different Humours, Tongues, Cuſtoms and Intereſts, ſhould una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly agree together to do that, which is ſo incredible of one ſingle Nation? This indeed is plainly impoſſible; unleſs we can ſuppoſe, that ſo many Nations ſhould meet together, or communicate their Thoughts to one another by Writing, and ſo all agree to tell what they knew not, to the Prejudice of Truth, and their own and Poſterities eternal Damnation, than which nothing on Earth is more abſurd: Or that God ſhould put it into their Hearts to deceive their Poſterity, which, even to imagine, is horrid Impiety.</p>
                  <p>The Sum of all that I have ſaid is this, That it is impoſſible the univerſal Conſent of the Paſtors and People of ſo many different Nations, ſhould concur and agree in decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any Article or Articles of Faith, unleſs they had received the ſame Articles from their Anceſtors; and it is equally impoſſible, that theſe Anceſtors ſhould have ſo delivered them, unleſs they <hi>had</hi> received them from their Anceſtors, and theſe from others <hi>their</hi> Anceſtors, and ſo up till you come to the firſt People who took up theſe Articles: And if it be found, that theſe people had <hi>evident Conviction</hi> of the Truth of theſe Articles, ſuch as true and real Miracles, it is equal
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103560:19"/>
to a Demonſtration that the ſame Articles are true; becauſe (as 'tis ſaid before) the working of real Miracles requires an Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Power; and the Light of Nature ſhews us, that God would not put his Seal to an Untruth. And if it be asked, how come we to be certainly ſure, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles confirmed their Doctrine with Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles? I anſwer, becauſe it is impoſſible that all the Nations to whom the Apoſtles and their Diſciples preached the ſaid Articles of Faith, ſhould all agree to deliver to Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they had received ſuch Articles up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a clear Conviction of their <hi>Senſes</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> by true Miracles, unleſs it were true that they had ſo received them. And this is an Advantage whereof all Heretics are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute; no <hi>Sect</hi> that ever yet ſprung up in the Church being able to derive its Heretical O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions from the Apoſtles, or firſt Planters of the Chriſtian Faith; but have all a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Period, beyond which they cannot aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to derive their Doctrine. To inſtance in ſome: The <hi>Arians</hi> for near 200 Years might claim the General Conſent of <hi>ſome</hi> Nations, aſſerting they had received their Doctrine from their Anceſtors; but when they went back as far as the Beginning of the fourth Century, all their Anceſtors are reduced to miſerable <hi>Arius,</hi> who at that time contrary to the unanimous Conſent of the whole Chriſtian World, denied the Divinity of the Son of God.</p>
                  <p>In like manner, the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> and <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians</hi> may pretend to a General Conſent
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103560:20"/>
of ſome Nations, for a great many Ages; but when they aſcend as far as the latter End of the fourth, and the beginning of the fifth Century, they are forced to ſtop there, and reduce their Anceſtors, the firſt, to <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorius;</hi> the ſecond, to <hi>Eutyches</hi> a Monk, and <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> The <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes</hi> likewiſe may ſay for themſelves ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like the reſt; but if we look back as far as the twelfth Century, we ſhall find them all terminate in one ſingle Merchant of <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>France Peter de Waldo.</hi> And to come near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er home, thoſe many, and almoſt innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sects in our own and Neighbour Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, who go by the General Name of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, tho' they pretend to have received their Doctrine from their Anceſtors for ſome Time; I hope they will not ſay (and indeed to do them Juſtice, I never heard they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to it) that thoſe Opinions they hold in oppoſition to the R. Catholics, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to them by their Anceſtors, any higher up, than the Beginning of the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Century; when, 'tis no leſs manifeſt, that all their Anceſtors were R. Catholics, than that <hi>Luther, Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> were the Inventors of their new Opinions.</p>
                  <p>Here, perhaps, it will be Objected, That this Conſent of Nations, for all the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Catholic Faith, is not ſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, as I pretend; ſince 'tis well known, a great many in almoſt all Ages have contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted it: The <hi>Arians,</hi> for inſtance, (to omit many other <hi>Sects</hi> before them) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted it in one Point: The <hi>Neſtorians,</hi>

Judges: Indeed, if they had all denied the ſame Articles of Faith, at the ſame time, and in different parts of the World; I muſt confeſs, it would in ſome Meaſure leſſen the Authority of thoſe that aſſerted them; for it is natural to think, that ſeveral Men of different Tongues and Intereſts, would, without any mutual Participation of their Thoughts, never agree to aſſert or deny the ſame things, unleſs there had been ſome Reaſon for it. But when one Man denies one Point or more, if you pleaſe, in one Age, and an other denies an other, in another Age, or, at leaſt, at a different Time; what is this, but one Man againſt all the World? To anſwer this Objection then; I ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That tho' it were true, that all theſe Heads of Sects had always oppoſed the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Conſent of the Church as aforeſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> One, in one Age; and another, in an other, or at a different time; this Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can no more prejudice the Faith, which we hold upon the univerſal Conſent of all the Chriſtian World, than if one Man, in the laſt Age, and an other in this, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the being at any time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII, or of the City of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſuch Impudence could leſſen our Belief con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that King, or this City.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. 'Tis not true, that theſe Heads, or Ringleaders of Sects did always oppoſe the univerſal Conſent of the Church: For, ſince they were the firſt, as I ſhall prove by and by, that oppoſed the Doctrine of the Church, and taught new Opinions contrary to what
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103560:22"/>
was believed before; they muſt have been for ſome time before they broached their new Doctrine, of the ſame Opinion with the reſt of the Church, who taught them their Faith; conſequently they did not always op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the univerſal Conſent; but concurred with the reſt in it, till they took up their new Opinions; and even ſtill continue to own, that the Doctrine which they oppoſed, was univerſally believed at the Time of their Separation. So that we have the Univerſal Conſent of the Chriſtian World, for the Truth of our Faith; even the Conſent of thoſe who afterwards oppoſed it, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
                  <p>Now that theſe Heads, or Ring-leaders of Sects, to wit, <hi>Arius, Neſtorius, Eutyches, Luther,</hi> &amp;c. were the firſt that oppoſed the univerſal conſent of the Church, in reſpect of the ſeveral Opinions wherein they are ſaid to contradict it; may eaſily be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; firſt, by the confeſſion of their own Parties, who ingenuouſly own that they follow the Opinions of thoſe Men in the Things wherein they differ'd from the reſt of the World; and have therefore got the Apella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Arians, Neſtorians, Eutychians, Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi> &amp;c. whereas, if any <hi>Churches,</hi> or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties of Chriſtians had held theſe Opinions before; they wou'd have continued in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them, and not have ſeparated, from all the World, as 'tis manifeſt they have, even by the acknowledgment of their own Writers.

                  <p>You ſee then, Chriſtian Reader, upon how fickle and ſandy a bottom the Faith of all <hi>Sectaries</hi> ſtands; and how firm and ſolid that Baſis and Foundation are, whereon the Catholic Faith is built, namely the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Conſent of all the Chriſtian World, which, if lyable to Error, we may juſtly doubt of the Truth of any thing in the World, even of what we ſee with our Eyes; ſince, as 'tis already prov'd, it is as impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the Univerſal Conſent of ſo many Nations ſhou'd conſpire to declare, they had received that Faith from their Anceſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors; if they had not, as that a Wall, for example, ſhou'd not be white, when I ſee it to be ſo.</p>

                  <p>In like manner, tho' we have Evidence of Reaſon, that the things we believe were reveal'd by Jeſus Chriſt; yet the Reward of our Faith is nothing diminiſh'd, becauſe we believe ſuch things as we neither compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend nor underſtand. And, indeed, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſeriouſly conſiders the great Work of our Redemption, he cannot but think, that it was moſt agreeable to the infinite Wiſdom, and Goodneſs of our Divine Redeemer to leave us this Evidence. Jeſus Chriſt came to the World, declar'd to a ſelect Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men, ſuch high and myſterious things as ſeem to ſhock Humane Reaſon; laid down his Life for the Salvation of Mankind, ſent his Apoſtles to publiſh theſe Myſteries over all the World, and threatned with eternal Damnation all thoſe, who wou'd not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them; and that, not only for a Time, but alſo unto the End of the World: Is it

not then very reaſonable, that this myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Doctrine ſhould always be attended with ſuch Characters and Credentials of Truth, as may convince the moſt obſtinate Gainſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of it; which, I am ſure, nothing leſs than either Evidence of <hi>Senſe,</hi> or Reaſon can effect: For, if the Evidence be leſs, then the Doctrine is only probable; and if it be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly probable, one may reaſonably doubt of the Truth of it; and if the Truth of it may be reaſonably doubted, the contrary, for ought any one knows, may be true; and if the contrary may be true, I am ſure, it does not ſtand with God's Goodneſs to condemn any Body to eternal Flames, for not believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Doctrine the contrary to which, for any thing that he doth, or can know, may be true.</p>
                  <p>Here I wou'd not be underſtood ſo as to mean, that none can have true Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out clear Evidence; for 'tis plain, that the moſt part of Mankind are taught the Articles of their Faith by their Parents or Paſtors, whoſe Teſtimony is confeſſedly fallible; nor do I pretend, that this is a Rigorous Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, ſuch as <hi>Mathematicians</hi> make, nor yet an Evidence of <hi>Senſe;</hi> but this I ſay, that the univerſal Conſent of ſo many Nations, as compoſe the Catholic Church, conſpiring in the Belief of ſuch Articles of Faith, make it as evident to my <hi>Reaſon,</hi> that the ſaid Articles of Faith are true, as any <hi>Evidence</hi> of <hi>Senſe,</hi> or Demonſtration cou'd make them, if they were capable of any.

Chriſtian Faith to ſeveral Nations, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd their <hi>Senſes</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> of the Truth of it, by true and real Miracles; and the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Conſent of the ſame Nations, which ſucceeded the <hi>Evidence</hi> of Miracles, is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convincing to us, that that Faith is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true: Conſequently we have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and an undoubted Motive to rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the Belief of the Articles of our Faith.</p>
                  <p>Now it is manifeſt, and even acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd by our Adverſaries, that, excepting thoſe who ſeparated themſelves, or were cut off from the Church by Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for their obſtinate Adherence to ſome Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors contrary to Faith; and whoſe Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot prejudice the Truth of that Faith, as I prov'd before; that excepting thoſe, I ſay, the Univerſal Conſent of all the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an World agrees in all the Articles of Faith, that the Catholic Church holds and believes. But among other Truths that are deriv'd to us by this Univerſal Tradition, or common Conſent of all Nations, as afore explain'd; this is one, <hi>That the Holy Ghoſt, or the Spirit of God, doth aſſiſt the Church, and doth guide her into all Truth neceſſary to Salvation.</hi> Hence we conclude:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Catholic Church is Infallible in all the Articles of Faith that ſhe holds and profeſſes: For, ſince the Holy Ghoſt is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Church to guide her into all Truth, and that this Holy Spirit is <hi>Omniſcient</hi> and <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> it cannot be affirm'd without Impiety, that it ſhould permit her to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Error.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:103560:27"/>2. That <hi>General Councils</hi> are <hi>Infallible</hi> in all their <hi>Definitions</hi> and <hi>Deciſions</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> For, tho' a <hi>General Council</hi> be but a <hi>Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> of the whole <hi>Church;</hi> yet, becauſe Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſemblies of the chief <hi>Paſtors</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> have been always look'd upon, even by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves (whoſe Steps in this particular the Church doth follow) as the beſt and moſt effectual Means of determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any Controverſie that may ariſe; and that all Good Chriſtians have always held themſelves bound to acquieſce to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations, and to ſubmit to them: it is reaſonable to believe, that the Spirit of God doth aſſiſt and guide them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> is <hi>Infallible</hi> in determining what Books of <hi>Scripture</hi> are <hi>Canonical,</hi> and what Books are not; and in declaring the true Senſe, and Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them: For, ſince theſe ſacred Books, and the right Interpretation of them are very neceſſary for the Edification of our Faith and Manners; the ſame Spirit which guides the Church into all Truth, does, no doubt, guide Her in theſe great and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Truths. We ſhall ſee hereafter what Society of Chriſtians can juſtly pretend to be called the Catholic Church. I now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to prove from <hi>Scripture,</hi> that the Church is Infallible.</p>
                  <p>But whereas the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are accuſtomed to carp at this kind of Proof, pretending that this is to <hi>Dance in a Circle,</hi> as They are pleas'd to term it; it won't be amiſs to examine what is meant by a <hi>Circle,</hi> and when it is to be admitted in Reaſoning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:103560:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>When two things bear witneſs mutually the one of the other, we call this a <hi>Circle;</hi> and when they have nothing elſe to ſupport the Truth of their Evidence, but their mutual Affirmation, then that ſort of Proof is Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: But when both, or either, have ſuch Evidence on their ſide, as is ſufficient to eſtabliſh their Credit before they bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs one of another; tho' it be ſtill a <hi>Circle,</hi> yet it is good and vallid in all ſort of Proof. Thus <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> bore witneſs of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and He again of the <hi>Father.</hi> Thus <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> bore witneſs of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> likewiſe of Him: And I hope no Body will be ſo impious, as to ſay, theſe were vicious or faulty Evidences; becauſe <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father's</hi> Teſtimony was known to be true, tho' <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had not confirm'd it; and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> his Works prov'd likewiſe his own Teſtimony to be true, tho' his <hi>Father</hi> had not born Him wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. In like manner, the Church bears wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that the <hi>Scripture</hi> is the Word of God; and the Scripture again bears witneſs, that the Church is Infallible; and yet this way of Reaſoning is not in the leaſt defective, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Church has ſufficient Credentials for the truth of its Evidence, before it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>receives a Teſtimony from the Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> The Univerſal Conſent of the whole Catholic Church, which, as is already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is undoubtedly certain.

can ſhew me any Text in <hi>Scripture</hi> more Plain and Evident to prove any thing elſe, than theſe do the Infallibility of the Church; I ſhall hold my ſelf highly oblig'd to him for that Favour. If the Gates, on Power of Hell (for they are both the ſame) ſhall not prevail againſt the <hi>Church;</hi> ſurely then it ſhall not fell into Error: For there are but two Ways of prevailing againſt it, <hi>viz.</hi> by deſtroying all the Members that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, as to their temporal <hi>Being;</hi> or by corrupting their Souls with <hi>Error.</hi> That the Gates of Hell hath not prevail'd, as to the former, our own Being is a ſufficient E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; and that they ſhall not, as to the latter; methinks a ſober modeſt man ought to be content with the Inſurance of Chriſt's Promiſe.

to their Biſhops, who were all R.

proves my <hi>Poſtulatum.</hi> 
                     <q>Now they were thus united (ſaith he, ſpeaking of all the Biſhops in the Catholic Church) by the Great and Fundamental Laws of one Faith, and one Communion. That the <hi>One Holy Catholic Faith</hi> is eſſential in the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>One Holy Catholic Church,</hi> is, even this day, a receiv'd <hi>Principle,</hi> I think, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all ſober Chriſtians: But then, I ſay, that the Chriſtians, in St. <hi>Cyprian's</hi> Time, reckon'd the Laws of one Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion every whit as forcible and indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable to the Being of one Church, as the Laws of <hi>One Faith.</hi> It was a Prime, a Fundamental Article of their <hi>Faith,</hi> that there was but <hi>one Church;</hi> and they cou'd not underſtand, how there cou'd be but <hi>One Church,</hi> if there was more than <hi>One Communion.</hi> By their <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings,</hi> a multiplication of <hi>Communions</hi> made unavoidably a multiplication of Churches; and by conſequence, ſeeing there cou'd be but one true Catholic Church, there cou'd be likewiſe but one true Catholic Communion. All other Churches or Communions were falſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> not at all Chriſtian Churches or Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</q> Thus far this Learned Man, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed very right: For it was the conſtant Principle as well of all, as of the Primitive Ages of the Church, that <hi>One Communion</hi> was no leſs Eſſential to the being of <hi>One Church,</hi> nor leſs neceſſary to Salvation than <hi>One Faith.</hi> And here I cannot but obſerve two things by the way. 1. How unjuſt that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103560:32"/>
intolerable charge of uncharitableneſs is, wherewith the Proteſtants inceſſantly Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the R. Catholics, for denying them Salvation out of their Communion; ſince it is manifeſt, as this Learned Man ſays, that one Faith and one Communion are equally neceſſary to Salvation: And no leſs evident, that the Proteſtants ſeparated themſelves from that Communion and Faith, which the R. Catholics believe, and maintain to be the true Church. How is it then conſiſtent with their Principles to allow Salvation to the Proteſtants whilſt they perſiſt in their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration? Or how can they be deem'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable for judging according to the known Principles of the Primitive Chriſtians, who knew but one Faith and one Communion, wherein Salvation was to be had? 2. What miſerable ſhifts the Church of England Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen are driven to, being forc'd to deny to the R. Catholics, in their own juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what they ſo earneſtly preſs upon the Presbyterians, in order to reclaim them, as conſtant and fundamental Principles in the Primitive Church.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Whoſoever ſeparates from, or is excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by the Church, for the obſtinate. Denial of any Article of the Faith, which it profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; cannot reaſonably be call'd a Member of the Church.</hi> This is Self-evident, as to the firſt part; for to ſeparate from the <hi>Church,</hi> is to go away from it, as the very Word imports; and by conſequence to be no more a Member of it. It is likewiſe no leſs evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as to the ſecond; for to Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103560:32"/>
is to put out of Communion, or to cut off from the Body of the <hi>Church:</hi> So that whoever is Excommunicated for the Denial of any <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> can no more be ſaid to be united to the <hi>Church,</hi> than an Arm cut off from a Man, or a Branch from a Tree, can be ſaid to be united to the ſame Man or Tree. All ſuch then, who wilfully ſeparate from the Communion of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Church, let their Pretence be never ſo plauſible, are properly Schiſmatics: I ſay, let their pretence be never ſo plauſible; for Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> tells us, as aforeſaid, that <hi>it is Impoſſible, the Church ſhou'd give them ſuch Provocation, as might juſtifie a Separation.</hi> in like manner, All thoſe who are excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by the Church, for their obſtinate Refuſal to aſſent to any Truth, declar'd to be an <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> are properly call'd <hi>Heretics.</hi>

                  <p>Touching the main Points in Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie betwixt the Proteſtants, and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> what the <hi>Greek Church</hi> holds and profeſſes, let us hear from the Pen of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Gentleman, Sir <hi>Edwin Sandys</hi> in his <hi>Europae Speculum,</hi> pag. 233. <q>With <hi>Rome</hi> (ſaith he) they concur in the opinion of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and whole body of the <hi>Maſs;</hi> in praying to <hi>Saints;</hi> in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular Confeſſion;</hi> in offering of <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and Prayer for the <hi>Dead;</hi> and in theſe, without any or no material Difference.

                     </q> Thus far <hi>Sandys.</hi> So that, tho' the <hi>Greeks</hi> were a true Church, it wou'd but very little help the Proteſtant Cauſe, nay rather, it wou'd very much prejudice it; ſince the <hi>Grecians</hi> hold thoſe points to be Orthodox; on the pretended falſity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Proteſtants ground their Separation: But of this more in its proper Place.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Touching the Church of <hi>England.</hi> This is of ſo Great Importance to our preſent Controverſie, or rather the only neceſſary Point to be Rightly underſtood, that it is requiſite it ſhou'd be handl'd with all the clearneſs and perſpicuity imaginable: And if it be poſſible to make it Evident, that this Church is branded with <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Schiſm,</hi> (two things ſufficient to unchurch any Society of Chriſtians whatſoever) I hope I may, without vanity, ſay, that I have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103560:35"/>
my Point. To prove then, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is both <hi>Heretical</hi> and <hi>Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> (I am heartily ſorry I muſt uſe ſuch hard Expreſſions to ſo many Ingenious and Great Men, whoſe Learning and other good Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties I very much honor and reſpect) I ſhall make uſe of no Arguments, but ſuch as are grounded upon the clear Light of natural Reaſon, upon the conſent of Mankind, and the conceſſion of our Adverſaries; and upon ſuch known and evident matters of Fact, as the moſt Impudent Wrangler wou'd be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd to deny.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt; That the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is <hi>Heretical,</hi> I prove thus: Whatſoever Society of Chriſtians obſtinately denies any Doctrine, believ'd by the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> to be of <hi>Faith,</hi> is <hi>Heretical;</hi> but the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> denies obſtinately ſome Doctrines, believ'd by the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> to be of <hi>Faith.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is <hi>Heretical.</hi> The <hi>Major,</hi> or firſt Propoſition, is a known Principle, which no Chriſtian in his wits ever denied: The <hi>Minor,</hi> or ſecond Propoſition I demonſtrate thus: The Church of <hi>England</hi> obſtinately denies <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> and many other Points; but theſe are believ'd by the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> to be of <hi>Faith:</hi> Therefore the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> denies obſtinately ſome Doctrines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd by the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> to be of <hi>Faith.</hi> That the Church of <hi>England</hi> obſtinately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the ſaid Doctrines or Points, is matter of Fact, and what She very much glories in: That the ſame Points or Doctrines were all,

And if this be true; the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which obſtinately denies theſe Points, and many more, muſt neceſſarily deny ſome Doctrines believ'd by the Catholic Church as of Faith; and by conſequence the Church of <hi>England</hi> is Heretical.</p>
                  <p>Touching the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is <hi>Schiſmatical.</hi> This is no leſs evident than the former: For, if <hi>Schiſm</hi> be a willful Separation from the <hi>Church,</hi> as it is defined by all Mankind, as well <hi>Proteſtants</hi> as <hi>Catholics;</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is doubly guilty of this Crime.

                  <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the begining of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> was acknowledg'd by all the World to be, at leaſt, <hi>Patriarch</hi> of the <hi>Weſt;</hi> and by the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> themſelves, to have exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd Juriſdiction over the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> for 900 years and more; even from the time

To this Complaint the Council anſwers, That if the Biſhops of <hi>Cyprus</hi> cou'd make out, that the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conferr'd Orders upon their <hi>Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> it was unjuſt to pretend to it now. And the Bus'neſs being fairly prov'd in favour of the ſaid Biſhops; the <hi>Council</hi> decreed, That the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> had no Juriſdiction over them, nor ought to pretend to any. Whence it is manifeſt, that if the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> cou'd, prove that he had conferr'd Orders upon their <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> at any time; or exercis'd Lawful Juriſdiction over them, the <hi>Council</hi> wou'd have Decreed the ſaid Iland to be ſubject to him; and that, as it was a manifeſt Uſurpation in the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> to pretend to any ſuch Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction; ſince he was not in Poſſeſſion of it, nor cou'd prove to have ever had it; ſo likewiſe, it wou'd be perfect <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Schiſm</hi> in them to withdraw from his Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, if he were Legally poſſeſs'd of it.

Certainly it wou'd look upon them to be <hi>Rebels</hi> againſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority the beſt eſtabliſh'd in the World. Nor will it any way help them to ſay, as they uſually do, that the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England</hi> has Power to Transfer the <hi>Papal,</hi> or <hi>Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal</hi> Power from <hi>Rome,</hi> and confer it upon the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> For, beſides that it is moſt abſurd to ſuppoſe ſuch a Power in a <hi>King;</hi> ſince it cannot be imagin'd, whence ſuch an Eccleſiaſtical Authority can be deriv'd to a Secular Prince; we have an expreſs Decree to the contrary in the fourth <hi>General Council</hi> held at <hi>Calcedon:</hi> What gave Occaſion to it, was this. The Biſhop of <hi>Tyre</hi> was anciently <hi>Metropolitan</hi> of <hi>Phaeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Concil. <hi>Calced.</hi> Act. 6.</note> and as ſuch, exercis'd Juriſdiction over all the Biſhops in that Province. <hi>Marcianus</hi> the <hi>Emperor</hi> (contrary to the Canon of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103560:37"/>
Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> by which it was provided, That there ſhall be but one <hi>Metropolitan</hi> in each Province) made a <hi>Pragmatic Sanction,</hi> whereby he Conſtituted the Biſhop of <hi>Beri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thum Metropolitan</hi> in the ſame Province, and ſubmited a great many of the former Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan's <hi>Suffragans</hi> to him; which when the Biſhop of <hi>Tyre</hi> expos'd to the Council, it was unanimouſly Decreed, That the ſaid Biſhop of <hi>Tyre</hi> ſhould be reſtor'd to all his Privileges and Juriſdiction, notwithſtanding the Emperor's Sanction, which the Council declar'd to be of no Force or Virtue againſt the Canons of the <hi>Church.</hi> So that it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, this General Council knew nothing of any ſuch Eccleſiaſtical Power veſted in the Emperor, tho' Lord of almoſt all the World; much leſs in a Prince of a few Provinces. 'Tis true, there is a Canon of a Council held, long after in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> called <hi>Quini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſexta-ſynodus,</hi> which provides, that if the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi> ſhou'd Erect, or raiſe any City to the Dignity of <hi>Metropolis</hi> of a Province, the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Power ought to follow the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral. The Senſe of which Canon, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive muſt be this; that either the Biſhop of the City thus dignifi'd, was to have the Juriſdiction of a <hi>Metropolitan</hi> over all the Biſhops in the Province, (the former <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan</hi> being reduc'd to the condition of a private Biſhop) or that the ſame Province ought to be divided into Two, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by two <hi>Metropolitans</hi> with diſtinct Limits and Juriſdictions. Whether of the two be the Senſe of thoſe Fathers, 'tis manifeſt, this
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103560:38"/>
Canon does not exempt the one, or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Juriſdiction of the Patriarch, much leſs from that of the Pope, as Head of the Church. And indeed, to give it the moſt rigorous Interpretation, it is impoſſible to ſtretch it any further than this; That when a City is made Metropolis, or Head of a Kingdom, the Biſhop of that City ought to have Juriſdiction over all the Biſhops in the ſame Kingdom: But this does not give the leaſt colour to any Exemption from the Eccleſiaſtical Power to which this Kingdom was ſubject before. Beſides, this ſame was not enacted by the <hi>Emperor,</hi> or any Secular Prince; but by a <hi>Council</hi> of Biſhops in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, doubtleſs, of the Epiſcopal Dignity; becauſe it was proper, that the firſt Biſhop, or <hi>Metropolitan</hi> ſhou'd have his Seat in the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the Kingdom, and take his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination from thence. And yet we ſee, this never took place in the <hi>Weſt;</hi> otherwiſe the Biſhops of <hi>Paris,</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> of <hi>Edenburg,</hi> in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and others might as juſtly pretend to a <hi>Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> in theſe ſeveral Kingdoms; which, I am confident the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> wou'd as much oppoſe, as any of the Reſt.</p>
                  <p>Now, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> did wilfully ſeparate from the <hi>Pope,</hi> from their own immediate Heads, the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and from the Communion of all the <hi>Biſhops</hi> in the World beſides,<note place="margin">Stow, Baker, <hi>Dr.</hi> Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, <hi>Dr.</hi> Burnet.</note> is plain matter of fact, equally atteſted by all Writers as well <hi>Proteſtants</hi> as <hi>Catholics.</hi> K. <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. did ſeparate from the <hi>Pope,</hi> and aſſum'd to

himſelf, the Title of <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> perſecuting and putting to death all ſuch, who oppos'd his <hi>Supremacy.</hi> After the Death of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> in whoſe Reign the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was again reconcil'd to <hi>Rome;</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> call'd a <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament</hi> in order to ſettle Matters of Religion. In this <hi>Parliament,</hi> all the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>England</hi> were depriv'd of their Epiſcopal <hi>Seas;</hi> ſome caſt into Priſon, others baniſh'd the Country, all violently forc'd away from their Flocks and Paſtoral Functions. Nor will it at all relieve the Proteſtant Cauſe, to ſay (which yet is their only plea) that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> were depriv'd, becauſe they wou'd not take the Oath of <hi>Supremacy</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd by that <hi>Parliament.</hi> For, beſide that, it is an unheard of Thing, that any Society of Laymen ſhou'd take upon them to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min Spiritual Matters (for ſuch was the Tenure of that Oath) and to impoſe them upon <hi>Biſhops,</hi> to whom it chiefly belong'd to determin ſuch matters: This Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding was contrary to the Ordinary Methods of <hi>Parliament,</hi> both before, and ever after that Time: For all things relating to <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Matters, are firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd and agreed upon in the <hi>Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> whoſe province and care it is to declare what is <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and what not; and then refer'd to both <hi>Houſes</hi> of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> to paſs into Law. But here is a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Matter paſt into a Law, which veſts the Supreme <hi>Spiritual</hi> Power in the <hi>Queen;</hi> and which all the <hi>Biſhops</hi> in the Kingdom
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:103560:39"/>
ſolemnly proteſt againſt, as a thing as mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly abſurd, as it was ever before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of. And yet they muſt be all depriv'd, becauſe they wou'd not ſwear to the Truth of, nor aſſert this Spiritual Power lodg'd in a Perſon, whoſe very <hi>Sex</hi> rendred her incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of. Indeed, they might as well deprive them, for not believing and ſwearing to the truth of the <hi>Alcaron:</hi> But this is too ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to need a Confutation.</p>
                  <p>That the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſeparated from the Communion of all other <hi>Biſhops</hi> in the World, is evident even to this day, ſince they never were able to ſhew as much as one ſingle <hi>Biſhop</hi> in the whole World, who profeſſeth to be of their Communion. Now if all this be not <hi>Schiſm,</hi> I confeſs, I know not what is. To ſeparate from the <hi>Pope,</hi> and all in Communion with him: To ſeparate from their own Biſhops, and raiſe <hi>Altars</hi> againſt their <hi>Altars,</hi> or rather to pull down all <hi>Altars,</hi> as they have done; to ſeparate from all the Biſhops in the World: If this be not in the higheſt degree <hi>Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> farewel Reaſon and Religion. And here I may juſtly make the ſame Interceſſion (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it) againſt the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with that of <hi>Elijah</hi> againſt the <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical</hi> Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whoſe perfect I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage I am ſorry they bear. <q>Lord, they have killed thy Biſhops and Prieſts, <hi>and digged down thine Altars; and we</hi> poor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted Sheep <hi>are left alone, and they ſeek our lives to take them away.</hi>

                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:103560:39"/>4. As to the Roman Catholics, I need not urge any more Reaſons than what has been already offer'd, to prove that this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Chriſtians is the True <hi>Catholic Church:</hi> For ſince it is manifeſtly prov'd, that neither the <hi>Neſtorian,</hi> nor the <hi>Eutychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> nor the <hi>Greek,</hi> nor yet the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is the <hi>Catholic Church;</hi> it remains, that the Roman Catholics muſt neceſſarily be it: However, I ſhall lay down ſome Notes agreed on by all ſides, to pertain to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church, which upon Examination will be found to be peculiar to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholic Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Roman Catholic Church</hi> is a Great Body of the Faithful ſpread over all the known parts of the World; there being but few Kingdoms known, where ſome Believers in communion with the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> are not to be found: Hence She juſtly claims the Title of <hi>Catholic.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we except the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> there are but few material Points in which all other Sects differ from Her. And moſt of theſe are condemned by the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> as are moſt, if not all the Points, wherein the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> differ from Her condemned by all other <hi>Sects.</hi> An Evident Argument, that ſhe alone hath the Truth; ſince, if theſe things which they ground their Separation upon, had been Evident, as they pretend, they wou'd all agree in them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All other Sects ſeparated from the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> begining, each <hi>Sect,</hi> in <hi>One,</hi> or <hi>Two</hi> in oppoſition to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103560:40"/>
the whole World: And we are able to point at the Age, and Year of their Separation; and at the Name and Character of each Sect's Author and Promotor. An Argument that She is the Mother Church, or Root of the Tree, and thoſe <hi>Sects</hi> ſome Branches fallen, or cut off.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Roman Catholic Church was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Condemn'd by any <hi>General Council,</hi> nor yet by any <hi>Council</hi> of Biſhops whether <hi>Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> or <hi>Provincial,</hi> for the <hi>Points</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> which the Proteſtants conteſt, if we except the <hi>Biſhops</hi> made in <hi>England</hi> by Secular Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when the true <hi>Biſhops</hi> were all diſcard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But the Opinions held by the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> and all other <hi>Sects,</hi> in Oppoſition to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> were Condemn'd by ſeveral <hi>General Councils,</hi> as every Learned Man can tell.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It cou'd never be made, out in what Age, or Year, or in whoſe Reign, or by Whom, any of the Points in Diſpute were introduc'd into the <hi>Catholic Belief.</hi> An Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Argument,</hi> that they were believ'd from the Begining; it being impoſſible to conceive how all the Chriſtian World cou'd be induc'd to believe thoſe things contrary to what they held before, and yet that no Man ſhould perceive it: Nay, it is Abſurd and Ridiculous to imagine, that the greateſt part of Mankind ſhou'd not be allarm'd at the Novelty of a Doctrine, which, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> ſhocks ſo, much both <hi>Sence</hi> and Reaſon; whereas the New Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of <hi>Arius, Neſtorius, Luther, Calvin,</hi>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:103560:40"/>
and the Reſt of his Tribe, ſo violently ſhook the whole Earth, that to this very day, our own woful Experience is but too ſenſible a Teſtimony of its direful Effects.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the <hi>R. Catholic Church</hi> hath the univerſal Conſent of all the Chriſtian World for her <hi>Tenets</hi> in matters of <hi>Faith;</hi> if we except that of the different Sects, which ſprung up at different Times; which, as it is before prov'd, amounts to no more, than the <hi>Diſſent,</hi> or <hi>Contradiction</hi> of one ſingle Man concerning <hi>One Point,</hi> in one Age; and of another, concerning an other <hi>Point,</hi> or more, in a different Age, at leaſt, at different Times; and that in Oppoſition to all the Reſt of Mankind: A Prerogative which no other Society of Chriſtians can pretend to; it being evident, and even confeſt by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that the <hi>Opinions</hi> which they hold, in Oppoſition to the <hi>R. Catholics,</hi> were taken up by certain Men in different Ages and Times; by <hi>Luther,</hi> in the 16th <hi>Century;</hi> by <hi>Wiclief,</hi> in the 13th; by <hi>De Waldo</hi> in the 12th, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will then conclude, That ſince the <hi>R. Catholic Church</hi> is as univerſal in its Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as, almoſt, the Bounds of the Earth; as Ancient in its Doctrine, as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſince it was it alone, that adher'd to the Ancient <hi>Faith,</hi> and rejected the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty of all Hereſies; and can only glory in having the Univerſal Conſent of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an World (as before explain'd) for the Truth of its Doctrine: This Society, and no other, is the True <hi>Catholic Apoſtolic

Church.</hi> I ſhall now proceed to anſwer Dr. <hi>Tillotſou</hi>'s Objections to this <hi>Point.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt is taken out of Vol. 2. Serm. pag. 50, 61, 62. which in Subſtance is this. <q>Tho' the <hi>R. Catholics</hi> be very Stiff, and Peremptory in aſſerting their <hi>Infallibility;</hi> yet they are not agreed among themſelves, where it is ſeated, whether in the <hi>Pope</hi> alone, or in a <hi>Council</hi> alone, or in both together, or in the <hi>Diffuſive Body of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> They are ſure they have it, ſays he, tho' they do not know where it is. Then he adds, There is not the leaſt Intimation in <hi>Scripture</hi> of this <hi>Priviledge</hi> confer'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> and it is ſtrange, the Ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> in their Diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Heretics,</hi> ſhou'd never Appeal to this Judge, it being ſo ſhort and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite a way of ending Controverſies; and this very Conſideration, (concludes the Dr.) is to a Wiſe Man inſtead of a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Arguments to ſatisfie him, that, in thoſe days, no ſuch thing was believ'd in the World.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſwer. I may ſay of theſe <hi>Three Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions;</hi> the firſt is neither True in it ſelf, nor in moſt of its Circumſtances. The ſecond is perfectly of the ſame Nature, if you except the Word <hi>Rome.</hi> The third is grounded upon a <hi>Negative,</hi> and proves nothing.</p>
                  <p>I begin with the firſt. "They are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, (ſaith he) among themſelves where it is ſeated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For my own part, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet read, or heard of any Catholic Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, that ever ſaid, That the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:103560:41"/>
taken for the <hi>Diffuſive Body of Chriſtians,</hi> was not <hi>Infallible</hi> in declaring Matters of Faith; Therefore, I think, All agree, that the <hi>Infallibility</hi> is ſeated in the <hi>Diffuſive Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſtians:</hi> And I challenge any Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in the World, to name me One, who ſays the contrary. The <hi>Pope</hi> is One, and the Chief Member of that <hi>Diffuſive Body.</hi> The <hi>Pope,</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> together, make a Great many Members; and if you add to theſe All the Reſt of the Faithful, they make up the intire <hi>Diffuſive Body of Chriſtian.</hi> If the <hi>Pope</hi> be <hi>Infallible,</hi> ſurely the Concurrence of a <hi>Council</hi> will rather confirm, than di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh his <hi>Infallibility.</hi> If the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> together be <hi>Infallible,</hi> the Conſent of the <hi>Diffuſive Body of Chriſtians</hi> muſt ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrengthen and confirm it; But if neither the <hi>Pope,</hi> nor the <hi>Council</hi> alone be <hi>Infallible,</hi> the <hi>Diffuſive Body of Christians</hi> muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be; if any ſuch Thing as <hi>Infallibility</hi> may be aſcrib'd to any of the Three, ſeeing both Pope and Council are included in it. We are ſure then the <hi>Infallibility</hi> conſiſts, at leaſt, in the <hi>Diffuſive Body of Chriſtians.</hi> But to illuſtrate this a little more, let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this familiar Example. If I ſhou'd ask where my Lord <hi>Major</hi> of <hi>Lond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n</hi> is, at this Time? And that ſome ſhou'd tell me, He is in his own Houſe; Others, not in his own Houſe, but ſome where in <hi>London;</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, neither in his own Houſe, nor in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> but in <hi>England;</hi> I wou'd willingly know whether theſe three ſorts of People do not all agree that my Lord <hi>Mayor</hi> is in <hi>England?</hi>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:103560:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Certainly they do; becauſe the aſſent of the two former is neceſſarily implied in the Latter.</p>
                  <p>In like manner, tho' ſome ſay, the Pope is <hi>Infallible;</hi> Others, not the <hi>Pope</hi> alone, but together with a <hi>General Council;</hi> and others, neither <hi>Pope</hi> nor <hi>Council</hi> alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Concurrence of the <hi>Diffuſive Body of Chriſtians;</hi> yet all do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> in this, that the <hi>Diffuſive Body of Chriſtians</hi> is <hi>Infallible.</hi> The Dr. then is very much out, when he ſays; <hi>they do not know where it is, tho' they are ſure they have it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Touching the ſecond Propoſition: <q>There is not the leaſt Intimation in <hi>Scripture</hi> of this <hi>Priviledge</hi> confer'd upon the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> and it is ſtrange the Ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> in their Diſputes againſt <hi>Heretics,</hi> ſhou'd never Appeal to this <hi>Judge, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> That there is not only Intimation, but even plain Texts of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which denote the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che's Infallibility,</hi> is what, I think, is already ſufficiently Prov'd. And ſince it is likewiſe Prov'd, that the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> or (which is the ſame thing) the Congregation of <hi>Faithful</hi> in Communion with it, is the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church;</hi> I think it is a neceſſary 'Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, that there are plain <hi>Texts</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> that prove the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> Nor is it leſs certain, that the Ancient Fathers, in their Diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Heretics,</hi> did Appeal to this <hi>Judge.</hi> For in thoſe days, there was no other Means to convince <hi>Heretics</hi> of their Errors, but by the Authority of the <hi>Church.</hi> In the primitive Times, <hi>New Hereſies</hi> ſprung up,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:103560:42"/>
as many, if not more than in any of our lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ages; yet there was no other Rule, or Standard to judge theſe Errors by, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Books of Scripture not being col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, or put together, at leaſt, in 150 Years after the Foundation of the Church; and then not one Book of it all, whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or Credit was not queſtion'd by ſome Heretic or other. How was it then poſſible for the Ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> to confute theſe Hereties, unleſs they had Appeal'd to the Authority of the <hi>Church,</hi> and told them, that this is the Doctrine of the <hi>Catholic Church;</hi> this is what we receiv'd from our <hi>Fore-fathers;</hi> And this is what all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World believes?</p>
                  <p>Neither is it true, that the ancient Fathers did not Appeal to this Judge, even when the Scripture was collected, and receiv'd as the Word of God: Read but St. <hi>Ireneus</hi> Contra Haeres. <hi>Tertul de Praeſcript. Epipha. de Haeres.</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin cont. Epiſt. Fund.</hi> and many more; and you ſhall find how much the Doctor was miſtaken in this bus'neſs. I do not cite the paſſages of theſe <hi>Fathers;</hi> becauſe they are ſo well known, and ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten quoted by Others, who wrote upon this Subject: But let this of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> (to uſe the Doctors own Phraſe) be inſtead of a thouſand: <hi>I wou'd not believe the Goſpel,</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Had there been an Univerſal <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Judge</hi> appointed in Temporal Matters, it wou'd, doubtleſs, contribute very much to the Peace and Tranquility of the World, if He were Obey'd; but very little to the Means, wherewith <hi>God Almighty</hi> deſigns to bring his choſen People to the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Heaven;</hi> which is to exerciſe them with <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery Tryals,</hi> and make them paſs thro' much Tribulation: And therefore He permits the Cruelty of <hi>Tyrants</hi> to try the patience of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and ſuffers the Oppreſſion of the Poor on Earth, to enhance their Reward in <hi>Heaven.</hi> So that the Cruelty, or Errors of a <hi>Temporal Judge</hi> do rather increaſe, than diminiſh the Happineſs of the Juſt. But the Caſe is far otherwiſe in ſpiritual Matters: If the Judge ſhou'd ſpoil us of our Faith, or err in Judging for us, it wou'd cauſe our Eternal ruine, our Damnation being neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily conſequent upon a Falſe Belief. And for that Reaſon, the goodneſs of God ſeems
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103560:43"/>
to be ſo much the more engag'd to ſecure the Spiritual, than the temporal Judge from error; by how much the danger is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on that ſide, and the Ruin more inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, if we ſhou'd chance to Err.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt threatens Damnation to all thoſe that will not believe his Doctrine, which, how it can ſtand with his Infinit Goodneſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he had provided Infallible Means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying the Truth of this Doctrine to them, it is hard to conceive. In ſhort, Temporal Eaſe, and Tranquility is of very little Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even in this Life, but of none at all in the next; and therefore generally ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, God leaves Men <hi>in the Counſel of their own Hands,</hi> and permits Them very often to diſturb the public Peace, and quiet of this World: But the true Knowledge of his Divine Law, and of the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of our Redemption, are of ſo great importance to our Eternal Happineſs, that his Goodneſs will Infallibly ſecure it for us, if it be not our own Fault.</p>

I anſwer, The ſame in Communion with the <hi>Pope,</hi> as it is prov'd before. And ſurely none will doubt, but we may be Infallibly certain, that theſe agree in the ſame Points of Faith. Conſequently we may be Infallibly certain both that there is an <hi>Infallible Judge,</hi> and who that <hi>Judge</hi> is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And if it be True which they tell us,</hi> ſays the Doctor, <hi>that without an Infallible Judge, Controverſies cannot be ended, then a Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie concerning an Infallible Judge can never be ended.</hi> And why ſo? Why may not an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Judge</hi> end it? Is not an <hi>Infallible Judge</hi> ſufficient to end any <hi>Controverſie</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever? If the <hi>Church</hi> be <hi>Infallible,</hi> and aſſiſted by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> for no other End, than to <hi>guide it into all Truth,</hi> ſurely it will not be wanting to it in this Point,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103560:44"/>
which is the moſt material of all others. But I ſuppoſe the Dr. grounds his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon this <hi>Axiom; no Man ought to be Judge in his own Cauſe.</hi> If he ſhou'd hence conclude that the <hi>ſupreme Judge</hi> cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide a <hi>Controverſie</hi> concerning his own <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,</hi> he muſt certainly be a great Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to all <hi>Civil Laws</hi> and <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> in the World. The <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> together are the <hi>Supreme Judge</hi> of all <hi>Cauſes</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> Now if we ſuppoſe, the Reſt of the people of <hi>England</hi> ſhou'd Diſpute that <hi>Prerogative;</hi> this <hi>Controverſie,</hi> according to the Doctor's <hi>Principles,</hi> can never be ended: Not by the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament;</hi> for it is their Own <hi>Cauſe,</hi> nor yet by the Reſt of the People of <hi>England;</hi> for it is not Reaſonable, they ſhou'd be <hi>Judge,</hi> and <hi>Party.</hi> Who muſt judge it then? No Body. So that, if we ſtretch that <hi>Axiom</hi> thus far, we muſt leave undecided that, without which nothing can be lawfully decided. The true Senſe of it then is this. <hi>No Man ought to be Judge in his own Cauſe;</hi> that is, no Private Man, who lives under <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> ought to Judge for himſelf, or be his own <hi>Carver;</hi> but muſt have Recourſe to the ordinary <hi>Judges,</hi> whoſe Sentence he, and his <hi>Adverſe Party</hi> are bound to obey. But this is by no means to be extended to the <hi>Supreme Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Power,</hi> whoſe very <hi>Eſſence</hi> is to Judge all others, and to be Judg'd by None. As to what he ſays, that a Controverſie, <hi>Who this Infallible Judge is,</hi> cou'd never yet be decided in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> I anſwer,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:103560:45"/>
there never was any <hi>Controverſie</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> concerning what is of <hi>Faith</hi> in this Point; namely, that the Church is this <hi>Infallible Judge;</hi> and what the Church is, ſurely no <hi>Roman Catholic</hi> ever diſputed.</p>

                  <p>Anſw. Let the <hi>Socinians,</hi> for once, anſwer, or rather Retort this <hi>Argument</hi> upon the Doctor. Had God, ſay they, thought the Knowledge of <hi>Three Perſons really diſtinct,</hi> each of them <hi>perfect God,</hi> and yet but <hi>One God,</hi> neceſſary to be believ'd by the <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> he wou'd have reveal'd this very Thing more plainly than any particular Point whatſoever, becauſe it is look'd upon to be the Chiefeſt <hi>Myſtery</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> but this He has not done; Therefore he did not think it neceſſary to be believ'd. Will the Doctor allow this <hi>Argument</hi> to be good? If not, I hope he will give me leave to have the ſame Thoughts of his <hi>Argument.</hi> For I am certain, there is no Text in <hi>Scripture,</hi> that proves a <hi>Real Diſtinction</hi> of <hi>Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> whereof each is <hi>Perfect God,</hi> and all but <hi>One God,</hi> ſo plainly, as it proves many other things, which are not ſo neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
                  <p>But has not God plainly reveal'd, that the <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>Infallible? Tell the Church,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103560:45"/>
and if he will not hear the Church, let him be to thee, as an Heathen and Publican. When the Spirit of Truth cometh, He ſhall guide you into all Truth. Go teach all Nations— And lo I am with you alway even unto the End of the World. The Church is the Ground and Pillar of Truth.</hi> Are not all theſe clear and plain? Has not Chriſt's own Mouth and his Apoſtle's reveal'd all Theſe concerning the <hi>Church?</hi> Surely then, he judg'd the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the Church neceſſary to be believ'd. And this is to a Reaſonable Man inſtead of a Thouſand Arguments, that He thought it not only neceſſary, but even laid it down as the Chief Fundamental Point of our <hi>Belief;</hi> becauſe this once firmly eſtabliſh'd, wou'd eaſily clear the Obſcurity of any other.</p>

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:103560:46"/>
For if we cannot abſtain from it, it is no more <hi>voluntary,</hi> but <hi>neceſſary,</hi> and therefore no Sin; and have not we, in ſeveral places of the Scripture, a promiſe of the Aſſiſtance of <hi>God's Grace,</hi> which is never wanting to our ſincere Endeavours; and if we have <hi>God's Grace,</hi> and are able, at leaſt, by this aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to abſtain from ſin; certainly we have an <hi>infallible Security</hi> againſt <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Vice;</hi> or if we have it not, how can it ſtand with the infinit goodneſs of God to condemn us eternally for that, which we cannot avoid? In ſhort, as it is moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his infinit goodneſs, and mercy to condemn no Man for what he cannot help; ſo it is but reaſonable we ſhou'd believe, he has given us ſuch means as will infallibly ſecure us, if it be not our own fault, both from <hi>Errors,</hi> in matters of Faith; and from <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Vice,</hi> in matters of Practice: But with this difference, that <hi>Free-will,</hi> without which there can be no reward or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by not cooperating with <hi>Grace,</hi> falls into Sin and Vice; whereas the aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt depending of no ſuch condition, as to its effect, infallibly attains its end, and preſerves the <hi>Church</hi> from <hi>Error</hi> in matters of <hi>Faith.</hi>

                     </hi> The Dr. I am ſure, repeats it ſeveral Times,

and lays great Streſs upon it. But in eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing this <hi>Principle,</hi> he does two things, which, I ſuppoſe, he wou'd not willingly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of, had he but well conſider'd them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He makes any Man of ſenſe, that can read the <hi>Scripture,</hi> as <hi>infallible,</hi> as the whole <hi>Catholic Church</hi> pretends to be. 2.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. He makes any Man of ſenſe, that can read the Scriptures, as Infallible, as the whole Catholic Church pretends to be: For the Catholic Church pretends only to be Infallible in neceſſary <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith:</hi> Now if all things, neceſſary to be known in <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> be clear and plain in <hi>Scripture;</hi> there is no Man of ſenſe, that reads it, but may be as <hi>Infallible</hi> in what is clear and plain, as any <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Churches</hi> in the World: For what is clear and plain to a Man, that he is, as Sure and Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of, as if all the <hi>Mathematicians</hi> in the World had demonſtrated it to him; ſince a Demonſtration ſerves for no other end, than to make a thing clear and plain: So that this worthy grave Doctor neceſſarily veſts, in every private Man, that <hi>Infallibility,</hi> which he endeavours with ſo much earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to deny to the whole <hi>Catholic Church.</hi> And ſurely, if one ſingle Man be <hi>Infallible,</hi> when he interprets Scripture concerning ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Articles of Faith, how much ſurer can the ſame privilege be aſcrib'd to a learned aſſembly of <hi>Divines</hi> compos'd of the whole

                  <p n="2">2. He Juſtifies, in a great meaſure, all the <hi>Heretics,</hi> that ever denied any Points of <hi>Faith</hi> on pretence that they are not plain in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> For Inſtance; the <hi>Socinians</hi> are Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Men of Learning, and their Ingenious Writings do ſufficiently witneſs to the World, they want neither ſenſe, nor judgment; yet they ſolemnly declare, they do not find one <hi>Text</hi> in <hi>Scripture,</hi> which proves clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and plainly the Divinity of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or a <hi>Trinity</hi> of <hi>Perſons</hi> in <hi>One God,</hi> in a True and proper ſenſe; which notwithſtanding is one of the Greateſt <hi>Mysteries</hi> of our <hi>Faith.</hi> What muſt we ſay of theſe Men? Can we imagin they wou'd be ſo great Enemies to their own Salvation, as to deny this great <hi>Myſtery,</hi> if it were clearly and plainly ſet down in <hi>Scripture?</hi> And if it be not, with what face can <hi>Proteſtants</hi> condemn the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſs to follow their Principles; and do, for that very Reaſon, reject this <hi>Miſtery,</hi> becauſe it is not plain in Scripture? Or how will they be able to convince them upon this <hi>Principle;</hi> ſince they are ready, as they have often declar'd, to believe the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> if it cou'd be made out, that it is clearly, and plainly contain'd in the <hi>Scripture?</hi> But why do I ſay convince them? Alas! They are ſo far from any ſuch thing, that the Abſurd and Ridiculous <hi>Syſtems</hi> of many of their Doctors, in their Anſwers to the accute and Ingenious Pamphlets of theſe <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics,</hi>

proclaim loudly to the World, that the <hi>Socinians</hi> have got the better, and fairly beat them at their own Weapons. And thus in rejecting the Authority of the <hi>Church,</hi> which Chriſt commands us to hear, on no leſs penalty, than of being reputed <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Publicans;</hi> they have open'd a door for theſe, and all other <hi>Sects,</hi> who are daily cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Throats with thoſe very weapons Themſelves have put into their Hands.</p>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:103560:52"/>
his too great Severity, as he thought, in this matter; ſo, no doubt, he wou'd have told him, that he exceeded his Commiſſion by ſuch a Procedure, if he had not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, that the like Power had been veſted in him.

at <hi>Rome;</hi> whereas it ſhou'd rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> where <hi>Peter</hi> was firſt <hi>Biſhop.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the firſt, I anſwer, that, by all theſe <hi>Titles,</hi> is only meant, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the Center of Catholic Unity; and no more is requir'd of any Man to believe concerning this Point. Now, that there is not only mention, but even <hi>Texts</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> clearly proving <hi>St. Peter,</hi> (whoſe undoubted Succeſſor all the World knows to be the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>) to have been made the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is already made out. 'Tis true, the <hi>Scripture</hi> makes no mention of theſe Words, <hi>ſupreme and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal. Paſtor,</hi> no more does it of the Word <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantial,</hi> yet the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Nicene Council</hi> did not ſcruple to make a <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Article</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> of it, and carefully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted it in their <hi>Creed;</hi> becauſe they judg'd it very proper to expreſs their Belief, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Divinity of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In like manner, tho' ſome Catholic Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters call the Biſhop of <hi>Rome, Supreme and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Paſtor,</hi> &amp;c. yet I do not ſee what Grounds the Doctor had to quarrel with them for that; ſince all Catholics agree, that they mean nothing elſe by theſe Words, but that the <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and uſe them for no other end, than to expreſs more fully what it is to be <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> But 'tis very remarkable that no Sect ever ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Church, who did not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this <hi>Maxim.</hi> They take hold of ſome words invented by the <hi>Church,</hi> to declare
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:103560:55"/>
more expreſly ſuch <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> as were conteſted; and becauſe theſe very <hi>Terms</hi> are not found in <hi>Scripture,</hi> they cry immediately <hi>Victory;</hi> as if our <hi>Faith</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted meerly in Words, and not in what is meant by them.</p>
                  <p>To the Second, I anſwer, That it is much more againſt Reaſon, nay altogether abſurd, to imagine, that <hi>St. Peter</hi> (whom the Dr. as well as I, muſt, in this caſe, ſuppoſe to be <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>) ſhou'd come to <hi>Rome,</hi> place his <hi>Chair</hi> in that <hi>City,</hi> and yet leave his <hi>Authority</hi> behind him at <hi>Antioch.</hi> This aiery Notion, I am ſure, none of the <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> in the Primitive Times ever thought of; on the contrary, they have always conſider'd the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> as <hi>Succeſſor</hi> of <hi>St. Peter, Head</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Principle</hi> of Catholic Unity.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeveral Objections more of this Nature in the ſame Volume, <hi>Pag.</hi> 244, 245. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And tho' moſt of them are levell'd at the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet I chuſe to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them under this Head, rather than the former; both becauſe of their Affinity with this, and for the <hi>Reader's</hi> Satisfaction, who, I ſuppoſe, won't be ſorry to find them anſwer'd in the ſame order they lie.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Doctor grants that, <hi>If the Roman Church be the Catholic Church, it is neceſſary to be of that Communion, becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>out of the Catholic Church there is ordinarily no Salvation to be had. But how do they prove</hi> (continues he) <hi>that the Roman Church is the Catholic Church? They wou'd fain have us to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103560:55"/>
be ſo civil as to take it for granted, becauſe if we do not, they do not well know how to go about to prove it.</hi> And after ſome pleaſant Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of Rallery, he concludes, that to prove a part to be the whole, is all one, as to prove, that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To anſwer this Objection, I ſay, firſt, that the Doctor here does very courteouſly juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Roman Catholics from that odious Imputation of Uncharitableneſs, wherewith he elſewhere moſt grievouſly charges them, for not allowing <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Salvation out of their Communion. He grants, that <hi>out of the Catholic Church there is ordinarily no Salvation to be had:</hi> Now the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics do ſincerely believe that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is the <hi>Catholic Church;</hi> conſequently, when they ſay, that there is ordinarily no Salvation out of it, they cannot juſtly be charg'd with the leaſt Uncharitableneſs; ſince they have, as it is already prov'd, the greateſt Aſſurance for that Belief, that any thing of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is capable of. And if it be True, as moſt certainly it is, that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is the <hi>Catholic Church;</hi> then ſurely the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics</hi> are ſo far from being uncharitable in this particular, that it is one of the greateſt Marks of their Charity to have that Love for their Erring <hi>Brethren,</hi> as to mind them of the Hazard they run, and exhort them to avoid it; tho' they are ſure they ſhall be hated for their Pains. 2dly.

In ſhort, this is matter of <hi>Fact:</hi> The Catholic Divine's Books, on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, are ſtill extant; and let even our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries be the Judges, whether this be not one of the moſt groundleſs Miſtakes that ever any ſerious Man cou'd fall into. 3dly. That he is as far out, when he ſays, that to prove a part to be the whole, is all one, as to prove the <hi>Roman Church</hi> to be the <hi>Catholic Church.</hi> Had we ſaid, that the particular <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Dioceſs</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> were the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Church,</hi> his Compariſon wou'd then indeed, have been Reaſonable; but, ſurely, he cou'd not be ignorant, that we underſtand, by the Roman Church, all the <hi>Chriſtian Churches</hi> over the World in Communion with the particular <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> which we therefore call the <hi>Roman Catholic Church,</hi> becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> being the Seat of <hi>St. Peter's Succeſſor,</hi> is the <hi>Center</hi> and <hi>Principl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If the Doctor had a mind to make good his <hi>Theſis,</hi> he ſhou'd have prov'd, that all other Societies of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who are not in Communion with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> are notwithſtanding their <hi>Hereſies</hi> and <hi>Schiſms</hi>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:103560:56"/>
a Part of the <hi>Catholic Church;</hi> he ſhou'd have prov'd, that the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> and <hi>Eutychians,</hi> which take up the greateſt part of the <hi>Eaſtern Chriſtians,</hi> are a Part of the Catholic Church, notwithſtanding they were excommunicated, and cut off from the Body of the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> by the lawful Authority of two <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils,</hi> whoſe <hi>Decrees</hi> he, and all other learned <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do profeſs to embrace; that the <hi>Grecians</hi> are ſtill Members of the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> notwithſtanding their will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Schiſm</hi> from its Communion; their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Error concerning the <hi>Proceſſion</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> their having been ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd and united to it, yet ſtill returning to their Vomit; but more eſpecially, their ſelf-condemn'd Perverſeneſs in their late Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the Communion and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> which they ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly, and in the moſt Authentic manner, gave under their Hands, in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> they wou'd hold and maintain; he ſhou'd have prov'd, that <hi>Luthor, Calvin,</hi> and all thoſe, who adher'd to their new broach'd Opinions, are a part of the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> notwithſtanding their being excommunicated by the Church, and their own Confeſſion of holding theſe Opinions in Oppoſition to all the World beſides: All this, I ſay, the Doctor ſhou'd have prov'd to ſhew, that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is but a part of the <hi>Catholic Church:</hi> But neither he, nor any Body elſe did ever ſo much as attempt it; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, moſt of the learned Men of the <hi>Church of England</hi> have readily given up the Cauſe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:103560:57"/>
in regard of all the aforeſaid Sects; and moſt of all other Sects do as cenſoriouſly condemn thoſe of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> With what colour of Reaſon then can the Doctor ſuggeſt, that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is but a part of the <hi>Catholic Church?</hi> Nay, can any thing be more plain, than that the Roman Church, as it is underſtood by Catholics, is the whole Catholic Church; ſince none of the aforeſaid Sects can, with the leaſt colour of Reaſon, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be a part of it; ſince they themſelves do unchurch one another; ſince they own, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is a Part, at leaſt, of the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> and that one Faith and one Communion are equally eſſential to the being, or Conſtitution of the one <hi>Catholic Church;</hi> in both which <hi>Eſſential</hi> they own themſelves to be different from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> So that, if we had no other Proof beſides, this laſt Reaſon is a plain Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that either the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the whole Catholic Church, or that it is no part or member of it.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a known Truth, and even vouch'd by all Proteſtants whatſoever, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is, at leaſt, a Part of the <hi>Catholic Church:</hi> That <hi>one Faith,</hi> and <hi>one Communion</hi> are equally eſſential to the Conſtitution of the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> of Chriſt, is a Doctrine ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally receiv'd by the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and, I ſuppoſe, by all the Divines in the World beſides; now there is none of all the aforeſaid Sects, as they all unanimouſly agree, that holds either the ſame <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> with the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> which yet they
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:103560:57"/>
hold to be a Part of the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> and which together with the ſaid Sects make up the whole Body of <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> It is then moſt evident, that either the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is the whole <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> or that it is no Part or Member of it. But the latter no Proteſtant ever yet durſt affirm; for if they ſhou'd affirm, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is no part of the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> this would vacate all their Pretences to be a Church; ſince it is from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> they pretend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their <hi>Miſſion, Ordination,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual Power,</hi> if any they have. We are then ſure, even to a Demonſtration, that, if what the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay be true, the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is the whole Catholic Church; and no leſs ſure, that neither the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> nor any other Sect whatſoever, can be any part or member of the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> whilſt they continue out of the <hi>Communion,</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To prove the Roman Church to be the Catholic Church, the Doctor requires the following Particulars ſhou'd be clearly ſhewn, and made out.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A plain Conſtitution of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> whereby St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and his <hi>Succeſſors</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> are made the <hi>Supreme Head,</hi> and <hi>Paſtors</hi> of the whole <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> Of this, ſays he, <hi>we have not the leaſt Intimation in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, nor in the Acts, and Epiſtles of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; nay, there is clear Evidence,</hi> adds he, <hi>to the contrary, that in the Council of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, St.</hi> James <hi>was, if not ſuperior, at leaſt equal to him.

                  <p n="2">2. To make good, that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> they are oblig'd to affiirm, ſays the Dr. <q>That the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Affrica,</hi> which were Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated by the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> for celebrating <hi>Eaſter</hi> after the Jewiſh man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and upon the point of Rebaptizing <hi>Heretics,</hi> were cut off from the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> and from a poſſibility of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> themſelves will not affirm, continues he, and yet if to be caſt out of the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Roman,</hi> and the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> be all one, they muſt affirm it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This <hi>Argument</hi> is grounded upon a <hi>Fallacy;</hi> and therefore the Inference is Falſe. Had the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Roman Church been <hi>convertible Terms,</hi> the Inference wou'd then, indeed, have been Right, and the <hi>Argument</hi> True; but ſurely Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> knew very well, we never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood theſe Terms ſo. The <hi>Fallacy</hi> then
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:103560:59"/>
conſiſts in this, that he joyns together the two different Notions of <hi>Roman Church, and Biſhop of Rome,</hi> and makes them paſs for one and the ſame thing; and ſo, by a cunning piece of <hi>Sophiſtry,</hi> concludes that whatever is done by the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> is likewiſe the Act and Deed of the whole Roman Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <q>In conſequence of this Propoſition, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> they ought to hold, that all <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> out of the <hi>Communion</hi> of their <hi>Church,</hi> is void and of none effect. For if it be good, purſues the Dr. then it makes the Perſons Baptiz'd, Members of the <hi>Catholic Church;</hi> and then thoſe, that are out of the Communion of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> may be true Members of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church:</hi> And then the <hi>Roman,</hi> and the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> are not all one. But the Church of Rome holds the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>Heretics</hi> to be good; conſequently the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is not the <hi>Catholic Church.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> His Inference is likewiſe here falſe, and ſo is his Conſequence. The Roman Catholics following the Ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> of the Primitive <hi>Church,</hi> do believe, that the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> confer'd by <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics</hi> with due <hi>Matter,</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> is good, and vallid; and that it makes the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd True Members of the Catholic, and conſequently of the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded there be no impediment of <hi>Hereſie,</hi> or <hi>Schiſm</hi> on the part of the Perſons thus Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd; but if they are engag'd in any <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,</hi> or <hi>Schiſm,</hi> they hold, indeed, that they
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103560:60"/>
receive a true Character of <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> but this alone neither makes them Members of the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> nor availes any thing to their Salvation: For, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays, all the <hi>Sacraments</hi> may be had out of the Church, but Salvation cannot. Now the Doctor, to make good this Inference, ſhou'd do theſe two things. 1. He ſhou'd have prov'd, that <hi>Infants,</hi> and ſuch as are not capable of <hi>Hereſie,</hi> or <hi>Schiſm,</hi> being Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd by <hi>Heretics,</hi> are out of the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church:</hi> For this we utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny, and on the contrary, affirm they are true Members of it, untill they forſake or renounce it, by actual Profeſſion of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,</hi> or by <hi>Schiſm.</hi> 2. That thoſe who are actually engag'd in <hi>Hereſie,</hi> or <hi>Schiſm,</hi> being Baptiz'd in that State, and perſiſting in it, are notwithſtanding, by virtue of their <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> made true Members of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Church.</hi> Cou'd the Dr. but prove this, he wou'd, I own, both gain his Point, and render glorious Service to ſeveral Thouſands of Ancient <hi>Heretics,</hi> who denied the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as well as to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> by making them all True Members of the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> in ſpite of all the <hi>General Councils,</hi> and their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But alas! This is what neither he, nor any body elſe will ever attempt. And indeed, if it were poſſible to be effected, we ſhou'd, I am ſure, be as glad of it, and as willing to contribute to the Salvation of theſe Men, as he, or any body elſe; but we have learn'd from the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:103560:60"/>
and from the Principles of true Charity, not to flatter any Society of Men with a falſe Peace, and Security, when we have no grounds for it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <q>In conſequence of this Propoſition, all the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the World, which do not yield Subjection to the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and acknowledg his <hi>Supremacy,</hi> are no true parts of the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> nor in a poſſibility of Salvation. And this does not only exclude thoſe of the <hi>Reform'd Religion</hi> from being Members of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church;</hi> but the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the <hi>Eaſtern Churches; (i. e.)</hi> four of the five <hi>Patriarchal Churches</hi> of the Chriſtian World.</q> Hence the Dr. concludes, that the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> is not the <hi>Catholic Church;</hi> becauſe it has not more Charity than this comes to.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Argument is founded upon an Inconveniency; and a great Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I confeſs, it is; but if we ſhou'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Exiſtence, or non-Exiſtence; the Truth, or Falſhood of things from their conveniency or inconveniency; the World wou'd be brought to a ſine paſs. 'Tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inconvenient, that <hi>God</hi> ſhou'd condemn all Mankind to death, &amp; to all the other miſeries, and infirmities to which human Nature is now obnoxious, for the eating of one ſingle Fruit; yet it is never the leſs <hi>True.</hi> 'Tis very inconvenient, that a Man ſhou'd be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to eternal Flames for one only Sin wherein he dies unrepented; yet no Man ever queſtion'd this Truth. We muſt not
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:103560:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
then conclude, from the inconvenience that attends a Thing, that is therefore falſe; but we ought to weigh the Reaſons, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, whereby we are induc'd to believe it is ſo: Now the <hi>Roman Catholics</hi> believe, that thoſe among the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Eaſtern Churches,</hi> which are not in communion with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> together with the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> are no true Members of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church;</hi> becauſe they have the moſt <hi>Authentic Records,</hi> and the moſt invincible Proof that any matter of Fact is capable of, that the ſaid <hi>Greeks, Eaſtern Churches,</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> fell into <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Schiſm,</hi> in which they do as yet actually perſiſt. What allowance God-almighty may make, for the invincible Ignorance and want of Capacity in a great many of theſe People; and how far he will be merciful and pardon the other defects of thoſe, who endeavour to live up to what they know, and want neceſſary means to come to the knowledg of the Truth, He alone knows. None, I am ſure, is more willing to judge favourably of their Salvation, than <hi>Roman Catholics:</hi> But to flatter them with hopes of Salvation, whilſt they perſiſt in their <hi>Errors,</hi> and have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary means to come to the knowledg of the Truth; and to tell them they may be ſaved with ſuch <hi>Errors,</hi> when we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd in our Conſciences they cannot, is ſurely no Chriſtian Charity, but the greateſt of Heatheniſh Cruelty.</p>

to the Salvation of Souls; they ought to produce expreſs mention of the <hi>Roman Catholic Church</hi> in the ancient <hi>Creeds</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Churches.</hi> But this, ſays the Dr. they are not able to do, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> (who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Pope Pius</hi> the ſecond) ſays, that before the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> little Reſpect was had to the <hi>Roman Church.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Juſt ſo the <hi>Arians</hi> uſed to object to the <hi>Catholics,</hi> that if the word <hi>Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial</hi> were of that importance, as it was pretended, they ought to produce expreſs mention of it, in the ancient <hi>Creed</hi> of the then preſent Church; but as the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics then anſwer'd, that it was enough, the thing meant by that Word was in the <hi>Creed,</hi> tho' not the Word it ſelf; ſo ſay we to the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that in theſe Words of the <hi>Creed, I believe the holy Catholic Church,</hi> is implied what we mean by the Words, <hi>Roman Catholic Church;</hi> tho' the Word <hi>Roman</hi> be not there. What <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> might, in paſſion, or upon ſome private quarrel with the <hi>Pope,</hi> have Written, againſt the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> conſider'd with reſpect only to the <hi>Dioceſs</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> I am not much concern'd: For I am ſure he never ſaid, nor writ, that the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> as it includes all the Chriſtian Churches in communion with the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> (in which ſenſe the Dr. cou'd not be ignorant, we always take it) was not the true <hi>Catholic Church.</hi> Beſides, if it be true, that <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> ſaid what the Dr. makes him here

                  <p>WHat we hold to be of <hi>Faith</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Point, is this: <hi>That the whole Subſtance of the Bread and Wine is, after Conſecration, chang'd into the Body and Blood of Chriſt; without any Alteration in the Accidents, or outward Forms.</hi>

                     <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> and his Adherents, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound theſe Words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> litterally, and therefore believe the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body in the Sacrament; but being however reſolv'd <hi>to Incommode the Pope,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Calvin.</note> as <hi>Luther</hi> ſays; they add, that the Subſtance of the <hi>Bread,</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> is likewiſe there. And to extricate themſelves from a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty which attends the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> they affirm moreover, that the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is every where. And thus they have brought forth two New Points of <hi>Faith,</hi> never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heard of, namely <hi>Conſubſtantiation,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biquitie:</hi> And this the Church of England Writers call <hi>an abſurd and monſtrous Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Calvin,</hi> and his Sectators, in Contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this, expound the ſame Words <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively;</hi> and therefore believe a <hi>Real Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> or, which is all one, that the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt</hi> is but a <hi>Type,</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> of the Body, and Blood of <hi>Chriſt. Zuinglius</hi> tells us, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was the firſt, that found out this Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the help of a certain <hi>Angel,</hi> which
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:103560:63"/>
appear'd to him; but whether he was black or white, he ſays, he cannot tell. So that, for ought he knew, it may be the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of a Devil; I am ſure <hi>Luther,</hi> at leaſt, did think it ſo; for he calls <hi>Calvin</hi> a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Calvin.</note> and worſe than a Devil, for offering to obtrude this Doctrine upon the World; and for wreſting the plain Words of our Saviour to ſuch a Senſe.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> neither expounds thoſe Words <hi>litterally,</hi> nor yet <hi>figuratively;</hi> for She neither believes <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> nor <hi>Conſubſtantiation;</hi> neither <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> nor yet <hi>Real Abſence.</hi> And to deal ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, I do not well know what ſhe believes in this particular: And what is worſe, to the beſt of my Underſtanding, nor ſhe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For in the <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> which is put into the Children, and common people's Hands, (where ſurely the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> muſt, if any where, be clearly and plainly expounded) ſhe teaches, <hi>that the Body and Blood of Chriſt are verily and indeed taken and received by the Faithful in the Lord's Supper;</hi> which, I am ſure, is the very ſame with the Doctrine of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent;</hi> her <hi>verily and indeed</hi> being the ſelf ſame thing with that Council's <hi>verè &amp; realiter.</hi> Yet if you ſhou'd ask any of her Divines, whether the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> be, <hi>verily and indeed,</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament?</hi> They will anſwer you no: If you ask them further; how can you then, <hi>verily and indeed,</hi> take and receive the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> if it be not there? Some will anſwer you, that tho' his
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:103560:63"/>
Body and Blood be not there; yet when you take the Bread and Wine, you take at the ſame Time the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to all the Intents and Purpoſes of the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> but this is ſuch a Riddle as paſſes my Skill to unfold. Others ſay, that by an Act of <hi>Faith</hi> you do <hi>verily and indeed,</hi> take, and receive the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when you receive the Elements. But if you urge the Difficulty farther, and tell them, that to receive the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by <hi>Faith,</hi> is no more to receive it <hi>verily and indeed,</hi> than to receive an <hi>Idea,</hi> or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of a Thing to which you give aſſent, is to receive the thing it ſelf: Or ſuppoſe it were, you ſtill admit of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body his being in ſeveral places at once, which is the Inconvenience you wou'd fain avoid, by rejecting the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> for if one, in <hi>London,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>York,</hi> ſhou'd at the ſame Time, (which is very poſſible) <hi>verily and indeed</hi> take the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> then, ſurely the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt needs be in two different places at once; if you urge, I ſay, the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty thus far, you are like to get no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, which either you, or any Body elſe can underſtand. So that, tho' the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> has in other things, many ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Advantages of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts;</hi> yet in this, ſhe is neither ſo Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable as they; nor ſo conſiſtent with her ſelf, nor yet with common Senſe.</p>
                  <p>Now to eſtabliſh the Roman Catholic's Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief on this Subject, and to ſhew the Unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs

of the ſaid Opinions (tho' of this laſt there is little need, their own Author's having in a great meaſure by their manifeſt Contradictions, and Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, already done it to my Hand) I ſhall endeavour to prove as clear, and as brief, as I can.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>That from the Begining, all the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Chriſtians in the World were of that Belief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I begin with the firſt.</p>
                  <p>The Words on which <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is grounded, are theſe, <hi>This is my Body which a given for you,</hi> Luke 22.19. Now that theſe Words are to be taken in a <hi>litteral Senſe,</hi> nothing can be more plain, both from <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Promiſe of giving his Body, as we read St. <hi>John</hi> Chap. 6. from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Senſe of theſe Words, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> and from the very Senſe which the Words themſelves muſt neceſſarily bear.

                  <p>
                     <hi>I am the living Bread which came down from Heaven: If any Man eat of this Bread, he ſhall live for ever: And the Bread that I will give, is my Fleſh, which I will give for the life of the World,</hi> Joa. 6.51. Chriſt promiſes to give his Diſciples a certain kind of Bread, which they were not as yet acquainted with: And to let them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:103560:64"/>
what ſort of Bread it was, he tells them, that it is his Fleſh; <hi>The Bread that I will give you is my Fleſh.</hi> This ſo unuſual a thing, as eating human Fleſh, cou'd not but ſtartle them; however they cou'd not doubt, but he meant to do as he ſpoke; ſince he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, that the <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Words be not underſtood in a literal Senſe, it is utterly impoſſible to know how any Phraſe may be literally meant, the Words, <hi>is my Fleſh,</hi> being by Chriſt affirm'd of the Bread for no other End, and his confirming with an Oath that it was ſo, for no other Reaſon, than to perſwade them that he meant as he ſpoke.</p>
                  <p>This is no leſs manifeſt from St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Senſe of the ſaid Words. <hi>The Cup of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which we bleſs, is it not the Communion of the Blood of Chriſt? The Bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the Body of Chriſt?</hi> 1 Cor. 10.16. Here the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> agreeably to what <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid, puts the Queſtion, as if the <hi>Corinthians</hi> doubted it; <hi>is not the Cup of Bleſſing which we bleſs, the Communion of the Blood of Christ?</hi> &amp;c. Now what is it to communicate, or partake of the Body and Blood of Chriſt? Surely it is to eat and drink of his Body and Blood; as, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, or partake of Bread and Wine, is to eat of the Bread and drink of the Wine.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>Wherefore whoſoever ſhall eat this Bread, or drink this Cup of the Lord unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, ſhall be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord. But let a Man examin himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that Bread and Drink of that Cup, for he that eateth and drinketh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, eateth and drinketh Damnation to himſelf, not diſcerning the Lord's Body,</hi> Cap. 11.27, 28, 29. This, ſurely, is too ſevere a Sentence, if St. <hi>Paul</hi> underſtood <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Words in a <hi>figurative Senſe.</hi> If that <hi>Bread,</hi>

and that <hi>Cup</hi> be only a <hi>Type</hi> and <hi>Figure</hi> of the Body and Blood of Chriſt; whoſoever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes, or takes them unworthily, ought, in Reaſon, to be ſomewh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>When a Man murders, or ſpills the Blood of an other, he is but guilty of his <hi>Blood:</hi> This is the common Language of Mankind, and no Man, in his W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Jews crucified <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſpilt his Blood, and abus'd his Body; yet the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſays no where, that they were in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, guilty of more, than of the Blood of Chriſt; and of more I cannot tell how they cou'd. For neither human, nor Angelical Wit can invent a heavier Charge. With what propriety of Speech then? nay, with what Reaſon can it be affirm'd, that Men ſhou'd be guilty of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, as were the Jews, for doing no more,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:103560:66"/>
than taking unworthily the <hi>Type</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> of his Body and Blood? In a word, no Man can be guilty of the Blood of another, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he ſpills his Blood, or takes away his Life; but St. <hi>Paul</hi> here affirms, that, <hi>whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall eat this Bread, or drink this Cup of the Lord, unworthily, ſhall be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord,</hi> and ſhall beſides, <hi>eat and drink Damnation to himſelf:</hi> Conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he believ'd, and was perſwaded, that this Sacred <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Cup</hi> were the True and Real Fleſh and Blood of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And this is ſo plain from his laſt Words, that I wonder any Man in his Senſes can entertain the leaſt doubt concerning it: For he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that the Reaſon, why they do eat, and drink Damnation to themſelves, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not diſcern, that that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Food, which they abuſe, is the Lord's Body; <hi>non dijudicans Corpus Domini.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is yet more plain from the Senſe, which the Words of the Inſtitution muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bear. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. <hi>This is my Body, which is given for you,</hi> Luke 22.19. The <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> tells us, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe words, that Chriſt <hi>took Bread, and gave Thanks, and brake it, and gave it to his Diſciples;</hi> and to let them underſtand what ſort of Bread it was, or rather, what he intended to make it, he ſays, that <hi>it is his Body;</hi> and to take away all occaſion of doubt, whether he had meant his true and Real Body, or elſe the Figure of it; he adds, <hi>which is given for you;</hi> ſo that they, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd the Omnipotent Power of Chriſt, cou'd
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:103560:66"/>
no more doubt, but that that, which he ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd them, was the Body, which was to be given for them. Now, if that Body, which was given for them, be the True and Real Body of Jeſus Chriſt; we are ſure, that the Body which Chriſt gave his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, was his true and Real Body: For he ſays, it is that Body which is given for us; <hi>this is my Body which is given for you.</hi> But all the World, as well <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics,</hi> agree, that it was the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which was given, and ſuffer'd upon the Croſs for us. It is then a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that what Chriſt tender'd to his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> was his <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real</hi> Body; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently his Words muſt neceſſarily be taken in a literal <hi>Senſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had Chriſt only ſaid, to what he held in his Hand, <hi>this is my Body;</hi> perhaps ſuch a propoſition, to one, who never heard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of the matter before, might ſeem Figurative; but when he adds theſe other Words, <hi>which is given for you,</hi> he takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all occaſion of doubt, and determins the Underſtanding to a literal Senſe. The firſt part of the Phraſe, <hi>this is my Body,</hi> is indifferent of it ſelf, and may be capable of either Senſe; but add the reſt to it, <hi>which is given for you,</hi> and the Senſe is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determin'd. So that Chriſt's Words can no more allow of a figurative Senſe, than, if a Man had ſaid, <hi>this is my Arm, which ſticks to my Shoulder,</hi> he can be underſtood to mean any thing elſe but his true and real Arm. In a Word, theſe Gentlemen, who
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103560:67"/>
are reſolv'd to deny things ſo evident, wou'd in my opinion, be leſs obnoxious to Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and more excuſable in human Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, if they had either queſtion'd the Truth of theſe Texts; or, like the <hi>Socinians,</hi> deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Omnipotence</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to effect this Miracle, than thus to ſubvert the very Foundation of human Reaſon.</p>

For the Bread conſiſting of Subſtance, and Accidents on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we cannot believe the veracity of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> when he affirms of the Bread, that it is <hi>his Body;</hi> nor his Omnipotent Power to effect, by his Word, what he ſays; unleſs we likewiſe believe, that the Bread is chang'd into the Body of Chriſt; but it is evident to our <hi>Senſes,</hi> that there is no change, as to the Accidents: Conſequently the change muſt be in the Subſtance. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it is impoſſible to verifie thoſe Words of Chriſt, in a literal Senſe, without a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Change: For the Greek Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative <gap reason="foreign">

be refer'd to the Accidents of the thing whereof it is affirm'd; but muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be refer'd to the thing it ſelf, which, ſurely, is the Subſtance, and not the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents: So that the Senſe of theſe Words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> muſt neceſſarily be, <hi>this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, Cloathed with theſe Accidents, is my Body;</hi> and then, if we believe thoſe Words, we muſt conſequently believe, that that Subſtance is his Body; and then this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily implies <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it is evident, that thoſe Words cannot with any colour of Reaſon, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in a Senſe of <hi>Conſubſtantiation,</hi> as the <hi>Lutherans</hi> wou'd have it: For the demonſtrative <hi>Hoc, This,</hi> as aforeſaid, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noting the Subſtance affirm'd by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be his Body; common Senſe ſhews, it wou'd be abſurd to interpret theſe Words, <hi>this is my Body,</hi> ſo as to mean, that Chriſt's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is there together with the Subſtance of the Bread, as the <hi>Lutherans</hi> groſly maintain; whereas, if Chriſt had ſo meant, he wou'd moſt certainly have ſaid, <hi>here is my Body,</hi> and not, <hi>this is my Body.</hi> But this is ſo publickly exploded by all the Reſt of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that it needs no farther Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All the Orthodox Chriſtians, from the begining, underſtood thoſe Words of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> both in a <hi>literal Senſe,</hi> and in a <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>

                  <p>I ſhou'd fill up a Volum, were I to bring all the Paſſages of <hi>Councils,</hi> and Fathers, which make for this Truth; no <hi>Miſtery</hi> of

This is, ſurely, to any Man of Senſe, but more eſpecially ought to be to the Church of England, (who profeſſes to receive the Acts and Decrees of this Council) inſtead of a Demonſtration, that from the begining of Chriſtianity to the Time of this Council, all the Orthodox Chriſtians did both believe the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Words in a literal Senſe.</p>

1300 Years ſince; and who, no doubt, knew very well the <hi>Faith</hi> of the Catholic Church of his Time touching this Point: Here is a careful Paſtor expounding <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Words, and Catechizing his Flock in the very Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the preſent <hi>Roman Catholics.</hi> He tells them that, ſince Chriſt ſaid, that the Bread and Wine were his Body and Blood; they muſt believe that the Bread and Wine were chang'd into his Body and Blood.

He tells them, that under the Appearance of Bread they receive the Body, and under the Appearance of Wine, they receive the Blood of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and that tho' their ſenſes may tell them, that it is ſtill Bread, yet their Faith muſt correct that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake; that they muſt not judge what it is by the Taſte, but muſt believe, that it is the Body and Blood of Chriſt, whatever their ſenſes may ſuggeſt to them to the contrary.</p>

be the Body of Chriſt? By Conſecration. By what, and by whoſe Words, is the Conſecration perform'd? By the Words of the Lord Jeſus. For all other things, which are ſaid, do give Praiſe to God, there is a Prayer premis'd for the People, for Kings, and for others; but when the Prieſt comes to make the venerable Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he does no more uſe his own, but Chriſt's Words. Therefore the Word of Chriſt maketh this Sacrament. What Word of Chriſt? Even that Word, by which all things were made. The Lord commanded, and the Earth was made; The Lord commanded, and every Creature was ingender'd. You ſee then how efficacious the Word of Chriſt is. Seeing then, there is ſo much Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy in the Word of the Lord Jeſus, as to cauſe things that were not, to have a Being. How much more efficacious is it, to make the things that are extant, to be chang'd into an other thing? Heaven was not, the Sea was not, the Earth was not; but hear him that ſays: He ſaid, and they were made; He commanded, and they were created. That I may anſwer you then.

                  <p>This, all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> confeſs, is very plain, in favour of <hi>Tranſubstantiation;</hi> and therefore they do moſt outragiouſly declaim againſt it, and even force their Lungs and Pipes, both to decry the Decree, and to expoſe the Authors of it. For my part, I am in no paſſion, nor heat; I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>ſoberly,</hi> and <hi>calmly</hi> examin what this Council was; what Authority it may juſtly claim, and how far it ought to influence our <hi>Faith.</hi> If it be found, to be only a Conventicle of <hi>Heretics;</hi> or a confus'd aſſembly of ſome Biſhops met together with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any authority from the <hi>Chief Paſtor,</hi> and other <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:103560:71"/>
to broach new Doctrines in oppoſition <hi>to the Faith, which was once deliver'd unto the Saints;</hi> then it will be but reaſonable, we reject their Authority: But if, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it appears to have been an <hi>Oecumenical,</hi> or <hi>General Council,</hi> repreſenting the whole <hi>Catholic Church;</hi> and that all the individual Members of the Catholic Church, at that.

                  <p>Now, after having examin'd the <hi>Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Acts</hi> of this Council, and conſulted all the (at leaſt) famous Hiſtorians, and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Writers of thoſe Times; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Writings of ſome of our Learned Adverſaries, I find, that it has all the Marks, and Characters, which even the moſt Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical Council ever yet had. I find, that this Council was call'd by common conſent of both Emperors, and of all the Kings, and free States in Europe; that it was held in <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Year of our Lord 1215. <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> the 3d. Preſiding in it. The beſt Hiſtorians of thoſe Times, tell us, that there were near 1200 Prelats in this Council; that the <hi>Patriachs</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> were there in Perſon; that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> being under the Yoke of the <hi>Sarazen,</hi> and Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Tyrany; becauſe they cou'd not come in Perſon, ſent their Deputies inſtructed with Power to repreſent their Perſons and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:103560:72"/>
As to Europe, the great number of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates there aſſembled ſhew, even to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that there were more than ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Repreſentatives of the Weſtern Churches. And what more can be deſir'd to compleat a General Council?</p>
                  <p>Now can any Man imagin, that ſo <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> an Aſſembly as this, ſo man Grave and Learn'd Men of different Humors, Intereſts, and Manners, ſhou'd all conſpire together to impoſe upon themſelves, and all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind beſides, a New Doctrine, in one of the moſt eſſential points of <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> contrary to what they had receiv'd from their Anceſtors; and that not one Honeſt Man ſhou'd be found among them all to diſcover the Impoſture? Or that all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſhou'd acquieſce to ſuch a Doctrine, and none ſay; <hi>this is contrary to what we have been hitherto taught?</hi> Can it be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, that the Biſhops who met here on purpoſe to hear every Individual Prelate tell his own Story; and to declare what Faith he had receiv'd from his Anceſtors on this Subject; who aim'd at nothing elſe, but to find out the Truth; but to ſee wherein they did all agree; and to reckon That on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as an Article of their <hi>Faith,</hi> which ſhou'd be found to be the ſame in every Man's Mouth; and yet, that contrary to the main End and Deſign of their meeting; and, what is more, to the eternal damnation of their own Souls: they ſhou'd unanimouſly agree to declare as an <hi>Article</hi> of their <hi>Faith,</hi> what they neither receiv'd, nor knew,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103560:72"/>
nor believ'd before? In a word, is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that any Man of ſenſe cou'd imagin, that in any Age of the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Pope, Patriarchs, Biſhops, Kings, Princes</hi> and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhou'd all agree to receive, as an <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> that which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> never deliver'd to their Anceſtors, nor their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors to them? And if this be abſurd, and not to be ſuppos'd, as moſt certainly it is; with what colour of Reaſon can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man refuſe the Evidence of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil? What ſhall we believe, if we do not believe ſo great, and ſo grave an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly? Here are, from all parts of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian World, ſo many hundreds of Learned <hi>Prelats,</hi> atteſting on no leſs penalty than their eternal Damnation, if falſe, that this is the Faith, which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> deliver'd to the <hi>Church;</hi> that this is the Doctrine, which they receiv'd from their Fore-fathers. Here are all the Reſt of the <hi>Prelats,</hi> and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the whole <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> likewiſe declaring, by their ready Acceptance, and Submiſſion to this Doctrine; that it is the ſame they receiv'd from their Predeceſſors. And now, if after all this, Men will be ſo much in love with their fancies as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the whole <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> both in its Repreſentatives, and in the diffuſive Body of Chriſtians, cou'd be induc'd to conſpire together to deceive their Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; againſt their own plain and True Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; againſt the Truſt and Confidence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd in them; the Duty, and Piety of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to their Children; the tender Care
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:103560:73"/>
they ought to have for their Welfare; and contrary to the main End and Deſign of the Divine goodneſs, who put his Word into their Mouths, to the end they might faithfully deliver it to ſucceeding Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and all this, notwithſtanding the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Lord, and the wrath of God reveal'd from Heaven, againſt all impious Lyars; notwithſtanding the dreadful <hi>Woes</hi> and <hi>Curſes</hi> pronounc'd in <hi>Scripture</hi> againſt falſe Seducers, and the horrible aggravation of their own Guilt, for having led ſo many millions into Error and Perdition. Add to this the promiſe of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi>'s guiding the Church into all Truth, the aſſiſtance of the Divine <hi>Spirit</hi> with it to the End, and conſumation of the World; the dear and tender Love of the great Shepherd of our Souls for his Flock; and the great care and concern, he has for the preſervation of his Church, for which he ſhed his moſt precious Blood: If after all this, I ſay, Men will be ſo far deluded, as to believe ſuch dreams; I ſhall only ſay to them, as <hi>Joſhua</hi> did to the Children of <hi>Iſrael; If it ſeem evil to you to ſerve the Lord, chuſe you this day whom you will ſerve— but for me and my Houſe,</hi>

                  <p>In this Piece, I meet with as copious a Collection of ſcrurrilous, injurious Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; of Notorious and Manifeſt Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; with ſo much diſingenuity in citing of Authors, and managing their Authorities, as I believe, was ever poſſible for any Man, who had never ſo little eſteem for his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, to bring within ſo narrow a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs.</p>
                  <p>Now to Anſwer all this Diſcourſe, and to lay open all its Diſingenuity; to ſet theſe <hi>Paſſages</hi> of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> which he mangles, and diſmembers, in their due Light; and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:103560:74"/>
to ſhew the Scope and End, at which thoſe <hi>Fathers</hi> aim'd; woud alone require a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum of no ſmall bulk, which in no wiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with my deſign'd Brevity; nor yet will my preſent Affairs. I ſhall therefore be content at preſent, to anſwer his main Objection taken from the <hi>Evidence of Senſe,</hi> which is the only Objection I find in all his Sermons; but with as many faces as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus,</hi> was ſaid to have; and ſome three, or four more, taken out of this <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> which are the only Real Difficulties in it; being reſolv'd however to lay hold on the next Opportunity to anſwer the whole, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph by Paragraph.</p>

His main Objection is this: <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation is contradicted by Senſe: The Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our Senſes is againſt it: 'Tis contrary to the common Senſe, and Reaſon of Mankind,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This He repeats over and over; and to enforce the Belief of it, he tells us in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places, that it deſtroys the External Means of Confirming the Truth of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. But he only repeats it; for I cou'd never yet find in all his Books, that he has made the leaſt offer to prove it. He wou'd have us, it ſeems, be ſo civil as to take it for granted: For without this, I believe, nay, I am ſure, he did not well know how go about to prove it. And 'tis a thing I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten admir'd, with how much Confidence his Good Man and Others, wou'd preſs this Argument upon us, without ever offering the leaſt Proof for it; when at the ſame time,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:103560:74"/>
they knew very well, we firmly deny it. And this ſeems ſo much the more ſtrange; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the more Evident any thing is, as they pretend this to be, the eaſier it is to find Mediums to prove it. But neither He, nor all the Philoſophers that ever were, or are to come, ſhall ever be able to make one good Argument to prove that <hi>Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> is contradicted by <hi>Senſe.</hi> For, what is <hi>Tranſubſtantiation?</hi> The Change of one Subſtance into another. Of what <hi>Senſe</hi> then is <hi>Subſtance</hi> the Object, that ſuch a Change may be diſcover'd by it? 'Tis of no <hi>Senſe</hi> ſure, but of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> as all the World knows. How can that then contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict Senſe, which is not the Object of any Senſe; ſince no Faculty can be employ'd, but about its proper Object? They might as well tell us, that Colours contradict the Senſe of <hi>Hearing;</hi> or <hi>Sound</hi> the Senſe of <hi>Seeing.</hi> Had we ſaid, that there is a <hi>Tranſ-Accidentation</hi> in that <hi>Myſtery,</hi> the Dr. wou'd then, indeed, have been in the right to preſs his Argument; <hi>Accidents</hi> being the proper Objects of our Senſes; but ſurely, we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaid any ſuch thing; conſequently we never contradicted our <hi>Senſes</hi> upon that Subject. We ſee with our Eyes, that the <hi>Accidents</hi> remain the ſame as before; we therefore conclude, that the Change muſt be in the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> which we cannot ſee; becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> told us it was his Body, and becauſe we are ſure, he was able, by his Omnipotent Power, to make it his Body.</p>

                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:103560:75"/>But, ſays the Doctor, there are all the Accidents of the Bread; and where ever the proper <hi>Accidents</hi> of any Subſtance is, there the Subſtance muſt neceſſarily be.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Suppoſe this were true, there is ſtill no contradicting of <hi>Senſes</hi> in the Caſe; ſince we own the <hi>Accidents</hi> are there, which alone are the Object of our Senſes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Will the Dr. himſelf ſay, that this is, and always was, neceſſarily True? No, for he tells us, Vol. 2. Pag. 67. <hi>That God may impoſe upon our Senſes, and if he tells us the thing is otherwiſe than it appears, we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him.</hi> All that this Argument proves then is, that ordinarily, and for the moſt part, the matter is ſo; but why may not God, notwithſtanding this, do otherwiſe upon extraordinary Occaſions; eſpecially in <hi>Myſteries</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> which are not ſubject to the ordinary Rules of Nature? And why may not we believe, that the <hi>Accidents</hi> of Bread may exhibit an other Subſtance to us; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince we have the Word of the Son of God for it, as well as the Accidents of a <hi>Dove,</hi> and the Appearance of Men cou'd repreſent the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and the <hi>Angels</hi> to St. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and to <hi>Lot.

And why may not we likewiſe believe the ſame God, when he tells us, that that which appears to us to be Bread, is his

Body? <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> ſays, <hi>I ſaw the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit deſcending from Heaven like a Dove, and it abode upon him, and I knew him not. But he that ſent me to baptize with Water, the ſame ſaid unto me, upon whom thou ſhalt ſee the Spirit deſcending and remaining on him, the ſame is he that baptizeth with the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> John 1.31, 32. Now <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> might have wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till now, and expected to ſee the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> deſcend upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and yet be never the wiſer, had he been of the Doctor's Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: For, if he muſt, in that reſpect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his <hi>Senſes,</hi> he is never like to ſee the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> who, ſurely, has neither <hi>Colour, Shape,</hi> nor <hi>Figure</hi> to affect our <hi>Senſes.</hi> And whatever <hi>Shape,</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in, St. <hi>John</hi> was ſtill in Right of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his Ground, and of affirming (if we believe the Doctor) that what he ſaw was not the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> but a <hi>Dove,</hi> or ſomething elſe: For he might have ſaid with the Doctor; the <hi>Evidence</hi> of <hi>Senſe</hi> is <hi>Infallible:</hi> Whatever my Eyes repreſent to me I muſt believe it: Take away the <hi>Evidence</hi> of <hi>Senſe,</hi> and you deſtroy all Knowledge: What appears to my Eyes, is a Dove; therefore I cannot, nor muſt not believe it is the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing elſe but a <hi>Dove.</hi> When you told me I ſhou'd ſee the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> deſcending, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I gave Credit to my <hi>Hearing,</hi> by which I perceiv'd your Words; and now, I muſt contradict my <hi>Sight,</hi> which tells me, this is a Dove. Or, if I believe it is the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> why may not I as well queſtion my <hi>Hearing,</hi> and doubt whether you ſaid any
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:103560:76"/>
ſuch thing to me; as I muſt now diſclaim the <hi>Evidence</hi> of my <hi>Sight,</hi> which ſurely, is a <hi>Senſe</hi> every whit as <hi>Infallible,</hi> as my <hi>Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> May not all theſe Queſtions, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, be urg'd by St. <hi>John,</hi> as well as by the Doctor? But alas! St. <hi>John</hi> never dreamt of any ſuch thing: For he knew very well, and ſo might the Doctor too, if he cou'd deveſt himſelf of his Prejudices; that tho' we muſt ordinarily Rely upon the <hi>Evidence</hi> of our <hi>Senſes,</hi> yet when God tells us, the thing is otherwiſe than our <hi>Senſes</hi> repreſent it, we ought to give Credit to his Word; becauſe we are ſure, on the one ſide, his Word cannot be falſe; and we know, on the other, he may impoſe upon our <hi>Senſes.</hi> And ſure, this does not deſtroy any human Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or Science; ſince it does not hinder but that, in all other things, we may rely, and that muſt aſſuredly, upon the Evidence of our <hi>Senſes,</hi> only where the Word, and Omnipotent Power of God it pleas'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe. Nor does it, in the leaſt, ſhake the External Means of confirming the Truth of Chriſtianity, as the Doctor wou'd bear the World in Hand it does. For, when our Saviour bad the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> have recourſe to their <hi>Senſes,</hi> to convince them of the Truth of his Reſurrection; he did not tell them, that they muſt not believe their Senſes in that particular. Since we are then, in all things, which are not repugnant to God's Word, not only allow'd to follow the <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of our <hi>Senſes,</hi> (for that we always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulably do) but alſo may ſafely believe;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:103560:76"/>
that the Subſtance, which ſuch Accidents, or Objects of our Senſes, uſually repreſent, is infallibly there; how can that Doctrine, which is warranted by the ſame Divine Word, in that, wherein it ſeems to be repugnant to <hi>Senſe,</hi> deſtroy the external Means of confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Truth of Chriſtianity; it being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that wherever Chriſt appeal'd to the Evidence of <hi>Senſe,</hi> for the Proof of any of his Miracles, he never diſclaim'd that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; nor ſaid, nor acted any thing, that might ſeem to invalidate it.</p>
                  <p>But, ſurely, this cannot be ſaid of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt,</hi> nor of St. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Dove,</hi> nor yet of <hi>Lot</hi>'s young Men: For it is ſaid of the firſt, that it is the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> tho' it has the Appearance of Bread; of the ſecond, that it was the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> tho' under the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a <hi>Dove;</hi> and of the third, that they were <hi>Angels,</hi> tho' under the Appearance of Men. Now, how can the Belief of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation</hi> deſtroy the external Means of confirming the Truth of Chriſtianity, any more than the Belief of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Form of a <hi>Dove,</hi> or of the Angels, under the Form of Men? Here is a <hi>Dove</hi> and two Men, in Appearance, and as far as <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Senſes</hi> can diſcover; yet they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd to be the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and two <hi>Angels.</hi> There is <hi>Bread,</hi> in appearance, yet it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd to be the Body of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Is not the <hi>Evidence</hi> of our <hi>Senſes</hi> equally diſclaim'd in both? Do not we believe contrary to what we ſee in the one, as well as in the other? Notwithſtanding, no Man ever yet affirm'd,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:103560:77"/>
that the Belief of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> under the Form of a <hi>Dove,</hi> or of the <hi>Angels,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Form of Men, did deſtroy the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Means of confirming the Truth of Chriſtianity. How can the Belief of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation</hi> deſtroy 'em then?</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee how groſly the Common People are abus'd, on the one hand; when they are made to believe, that <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> is ſo monſtrouſly abſurd, as the Dr. wou'd fain here paint it: And how har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy He himſelf muſt needs have been, on the other, when he had the Courage to deliver out of the very Pulpit, the <hi>Chair</hi> of Truth, that it was, as evidently contrary to the common <hi>Senſe</hi> of Mankind, as it is evident that <hi>twice two</hi> make <hi>four.</hi> vol. 5. pag. 18, 19. But I have an other Challenge to him yet: He tells us in the foregoing Page, <hi>that in things doubtful, a modeſt Man wou'd be very apt to be ſtagger'd by the judgment of a very Wiſe Man; and much more, of many ſuch, and eſpecially by the unanimous Judgment of the Generality of Men, the General Voice and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of Mankind, being next to the Voice of God himſelf.</hi> And, a little after, He gives this Reaſon for it; <hi>becauſe in things lawful and indifferent, we are bound by the Rules of Decency, and Civility not to thwart the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Practice, and by the Commands of God, we are certainly oblig'd to obey the lawful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of lawful Authority.</hi> Since then the falſhood of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is not only <hi>doubtful,</hi> but the Truth of it is eſtabliſh'd upon the firmeſt Foundation, either in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:103560:77"/>
or on Earth; even upon that <hi>Word,</hi> which ſhall never paſs away, tho' Heaven and Earth ſhall; and ſince the belief of it, when the <hi>Reformation</hi> began, was grounded upon the General Voice and Opinion of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Mankind, as the Doctor, and all thoſe of his Perſwaſion do acknowledg; and upon the lawful Commands of lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, if any ſuch thing were on Earth; I appeal to his own Judgment, if every Man be not bound, both in Decency, and Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and by the Commands of God, not to thwart, or contradict a Point of <hi>Faith</hi> ſo firmly eſtabliſh'd.</p>
                  <p>And now, if, after all this, any Man will undertake to juſtifie the Doctor's Conduct, and Vindicate what he writ againſt <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation;</hi> I here make him this fair offer, for his encouragement; that tho' this good Doctor is pleas'd to ſay,<note place="margin">Vol. 3. pag. 299.</note> 
                     <hi>that in the bus'neſs of Tranſubſtantiation, it is not a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie of Scripture againſt Scripture, or of Reaſon againſt Reaſon, but of down right Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence</hi> (civily ſpoken) <hi>againſt the plain meaning of Scripture, and the Senſe, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Mankind:</hi> If He, I ſay, or any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy elſe will bring but one ſingle Argument in <hi>Mood,</hi> and <hi>Figure,</hi> to prove that <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation</hi> does either contradict Senſe or Reaſon, I do ſincerely promiſe him, I will be of his Opinion the very next Moment. And this I do the more confidently affirm, becauſe I am ſure, <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> cannot poſſibly contradict, or be againſt Senſe or Reaſon. <hi>Senſe</hi> it cannot; for it is not the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:103560:78"/>
Object of any of our <hi>Senſes;</hi> and, ſurely, it is not againſt Reaſon, that one Subſtance ſhou'd be chang'd into an other; ſince all Generations, and Corruptions are thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd; and even daily Experience teaches us, that the Meat, on which wee feed, does not nouriſh us, but in as much, as it is chang'd into the ſubſtance of our Fleſh. And to let the World know, it is not the Roman Catholics alone, who ſee the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of this Pretence, I will Tranſcribe the Words of an Ingenious <hi>Soci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tan</hi> upon this Subject, who, ſurely, is no more a Friend to the <hi>Roman Catholics,</hi> than to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. They are taken out of a Book Intitul'd; <hi>Conſiderations on the Explication of the Trinity,</hi> &amp;c. Pag. 21. He cites the Words of the Biſhop of <hi>Sarum,</hi> taken out of his <hi>Diſcourſe concerning the Divinity, and Death of Chriſt,</hi> pag. 94. which are theſe: <hi>Tranſubſtantiation muſt not be a Myſtery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is againſt it, the Evidence of Senſe, in an Object of Senſe: For Senſe plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents to us the Bread and Wine, to be ſtill the ſame, that they were before the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus he ſpeaks his own Thoughts of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This is, (ſays he) every way faulty; for it is not pretended by the Papiſts, that the Bread and Wine have received any the leaſt Change, in what is an Object of Senſe. The Papiſts following the Philoſophy of</hi> Ariſtotle, <hi>diſtinguiſh in Bodys theſe two things; the Accidents (ſuch as the quantity, figure, colour, ſmell, taſte,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103560:78"/>
and ſuch like) which are Objects of our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: And the Subſtance which bears, and is cloathed (as it were) with theſe viſible, and ſenſible Accidents; but is it ſelf inviſible, and the Object of our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, not of our Senſes. They ſay hereupon, our Saviour having call'd the Sacrament, his Body and Blood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Senſes aſſure us, there is no change of the (ſenſible) Accidents; therefore the change, that is made, muſt be in the (invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) Subſtance: Which change they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore call Tranſubſtantiation. Nor do they ſay, that Chriſt is corporally (or bodily) preſent in the Sacrament, but that His Body is preſent, in a ſpiritual manner: As Cardinal</hi> Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min <hi>largely diſcourſes.</hi> De Euchariſt. l. 1. c. 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His Lordſhip therefore is greatly out, in pretending that the Tranſubſtantiation, as held by the Papiſts, is contradicted by Senſe, in an Object of Senſe.</hi> Thus far this Ingenious Man. Whence 'tis evident how miſerably weak the Doctor's pretence to Evidence of <hi>Senſe</hi> againſt this Myſtery is; and how groſly he abuſes Mankind, when alluding to <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,</hi> he tells them, they do not come to learn from their Guids, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors <hi>the difference between Sea, and dry Land,</hi>

                  <p>Theſe and ſome more of leſs moment are, by the Dr. very much magnified and cry'd up; and, to do him juſtice, he ſpares no Art, nor Induſtry to improve them to the beſt Advantage; peremptorily conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the Foot of each Paſſage, that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> was unknown to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. But before I anſwer them, it will be requiſite, for the better Underſtanding of theſe <hi>Fathers,</hi> to obſerve,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What Conduct the ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally held, when they treated of the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi> of the Lord's Body and Blood, in the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What was the ancient Father's Belief concerning this <hi>Myſtery;</hi> and</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whence theſe Paſſages objected are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: Which if well conſider'd, I doubt not to make it appear, that theſe Objections, notwithſtanding their plauſible appearance, do not, in the leaſt, prejudice the Truth of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> nor claſh with the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's</hi> Opinions, who Favour this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Fathers</hi> here objected, and moſt of the Ancients, were very cautious how they ſpoke any thing on this Subject, which might increaſe the Suſpicion the <hi>Gentils</hi> had conceiv'd of them, as if
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:103560:80"/>
they us'd to eat Human Fleſh, in the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of their <hi>Myſteries;</hi> which, no doubt, was occaſion'd by the Information of ſome <hi>Apoſtat Chriſtians,</hi> who, upon renouncing of their <hi>Faith,</hi> declar'd, that the Chriſtians us'd to eat the Fleſh and Blood of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> They were therefore, to avoid the Reproach and <hi>Odium,</hi> which they muſt hereupon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily incur, (the <hi>Gentils</hi> thinking they eat this Fleſh, as Men do that, which is fold in the Shambles) very careful to conceal this <hi>Myſtery;</hi> and to write nothing, that was to be expos'd to the <hi>Infidels,</hi> which might ſeem to inſinuate any ſuch Doctrine; being content to glance at it, and (when they muſt) to deliver their Thoughts obſcurely; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very well, that, by this prudent Conduct, the <hi>Pagans</hi> wou'd have no juſt Reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them, and the Chriſtians, who were carefully inſtructed in this Point, wou'd eaſily underſtand what they hinted at. So that, in their Treatiſes againſt Heretics, in the Books they muſt have expos'd to public view, for the comfort, and inſtruction of the Chriſtians, and the converſion of the Gentils; but more eſpecially, in their public Sermons and Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, where they apprehended any Pagans were preſent, they were very careful to ſpeak nothing out, touching this Point; but by hints and glances, to inſinuate their meaning to the Chriſtians, ſo as the Pagans cou'd not underſtand what they meant. Thus <hi>Tertulian,</hi> in the Book, which he wrote to diſwade his Wife from Marrying after his Deceaſe; <hi>Non ſciet Maritus quid ante omnem cibum guſtes, &amp;
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:103560:80"/>
ſi ſciverit, Panem eſſe credet, &amp; non quod dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Your Husband will not know that, which you taſte before all other Meat; and if he does, he will think it is Bread, and not what it is call'd.</hi> Here a <hi>Pagan</hi> knows not what he means, but his Wife, and all other Chriſtians might eaſily underſtand, that he means the Body of Chriſt. Thus St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, inſinuates this <hi>Myſtery</hi> in obſcure words, and then adds, theſe fam'd Words; <hi>Nôrunt fideles, Nôrunt fideles quod dico: The Faithful know, the Faithful know what I ſay.</hi> Thus <hi>Theodoret,</hi> in that very <hi>Dialogue</hi> objected by the Doctor, puts theſe Words in <hi>Orthodoxus</hi> his Mouth; <hi>Oro te ut obſcurius reſpondeas, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunt enim fortaſſe aliqui Myſteriis non initiati. I beſeech you anſwer more obſcurely; for there are ſome perhaps here preſent, who are not ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated in the Myſteries.</hi> This he ſaid, becauſe they were about to talk of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> as appears by the Words of the <hi>Dialogue. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raniſtes</hi> anſwers him; <hi>ſic audiam, &amp; ſic re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondebo: So I will hear, and ſo I will anſwer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It were needleſs to bring any more Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities from Fathers to prove this Truth, it being evident from the Conduct obſerv'd in reſpect of the <hi>Catechumens,</hi> that this was the univerſal Practiſe of the primitive Church. Theſe <hi>Catechumens</hi> were <hi>Candidates</hi> for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; they were taught, and inſtructed in all the other <hi>Myſteries</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith;</hi> but not one Word did they hear of, or relating to the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> till they had, by long Tryal and Experience, given ſufficient Proof of their Good Reſolutions; and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:103560:81"/>
promis'd to believe, whatever the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> taught and profeſs'd. Tho' they were taught the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and <hi>Incarnation;</hi> tho' they were allow'd to hear the Goſpel read and expounded, and to aſſiſt at the Reſt of the Divine Service; yet, when the Conſecration, and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> was to be perform'd, they were by no means admitted to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nor as much as know any thing of it; but were diſmiſs'd, and excluded from that part of the Service, till by long, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inſtructions they were deem'd <hi>competent</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">hence the name of <hi>Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentes</hi> &amp; <hi>miſſa Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techume norum</hi> ſo often mention'd by the Canons.</note> to aſſiſt at it, as they then phras'd it. So careful were the Primitive <hi>Fathers,</hi> that none, ſhou'd come to the Knowledge of this <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> but ſuch as were very well diſpos'd to believe, and embrace it.</p>
                  <p>And now can any Man of Senſe imagin, that theſe Holy and Learned <hi>Fathers</hi> ſhou'd keep ſuch a ſtir about the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> or be ſo careful to conceal it; were it but a <hi>Type,</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> of the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> What is more eaſie to be believ'd, than that Bread repreſents the Body of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and Wine, his Blood; and that both are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in remembrance of his Death, and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? Surely, there is nothing in the world ſo eaſie to be perſwaded; ſince all Mankind knows, that ſuch arbitrary Signs or Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations, depend meerly of the Will of him that inſtitutes them; and that there is nothing to be done to perſwade their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, but to tell, that they are ſo. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no <hi>Pagan,</hi> or <hi>Gentil</hi> cou'd ever be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:103560:81"/>
at a thing ſo plain, or offer the leaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the Chriſtian Religion upon the account of it: Conſequently there wou'd be no need to conceal, or ſpeak obſcurely of it; nor to hinder, not only <hi>Catechumens,</hi> but even <hi>Pagans,</hi> or <hi>Infidels,</hi> to hear it taught and deliver'd. But to proceed:</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What the ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> believ'd, touching the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> was this; that the Subſtance of the Bread and Wine, was chang'd into the Body and Blood of Chriſt; as appears by the paſſages produc'd from their Works, where the <hi>Fathers,</hi> in their Catechiſms and Homilies, make it their Bus'neſs to explain this <hi>Myſtery</hi> to the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. And becauſe their Senſes gave them to underſtand, that the outward <hi>Forms,</hi> or <hi>Accidents</hi> remain'd; theſe they call'd the <hi>Sign,</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> of Chriſt's Body; becauſe they repreſent unto us the Body of Chriſt, which is, as it were cloath'd with theſe <hi>Accidents.</hi> So that the ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd this Sacrament to be both the <hi>Figure,</hi> and <hi>Reality</hi> of the Body of Chriſt, according to the two different things they diſcover'd in it; <hi>viz.</hi> the outward Signs or Simbols, and the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which are vail'd and cover'd by them. Hence St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſays; <hi>under the Type and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Bread he gives you his Body, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Figure of Wine he gives you his Blood.</hi> And <hi>Gratian</hi> Diſtinct. 2. C. Hoc eſt de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrat. ſays; <hi>Hoc eſt quod dicimus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This is what we ſay, and what by all means we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prove; that the Sacrifice of the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:103560:82"/>
Church is made of two Things, conſiſts of two Things; of the viſible Appearance of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and of the inviſible Fleſh and Blood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; of the Sacrament, that is, of the External and Sacred Sign; and of the thing of the Sacrament, Re Sacramenti, that is, of the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt.</hi> Again, <hi>Caro ejus eſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>'Tis his Fleſh, which we receive, in the Sacrament, vail'd with the Form of Bread; and his Blood, which we drink, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Appearance, and taſte of Wine.</hi> But for all, the <hi>Fathers</hi> do very often, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in their Diſputes with <hi>Heretics;</hi> and when they apprehend their Writings ſhou'd fall into the Hands of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> call the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> the <hi>Sign</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood; becauſe in effect it is ſo, in regard of the <hi>Accidents,</hi> or outward <hi>Forms;</hi> yet we do not find, that they ever call'd it a <hi>Sign,</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> only, with excluſion to the Reality of Chriſt's Fleſh and Blood.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. 'Tis very material to our preſent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute to know whence thoſe Paſſages objected by the Doctor are taken. And this he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is careful to tell us; namely, that they are taken out of thoſe Father's Diſputes with <hi>Heretics;</hi> In which ſort of Writing, it is natural for any Man to take all kind of juſt advantage of his Adverſary, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to confute him; even to the ſilencing of ſome part of the Truth, when it is not to his purpoſe, nor abſolutely necceſſary to be declar'd. So that it is very hard to gather thoſe <hi>Father's</hi> Opinions from ſuch Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, much more, to eſtabliſh an <hi>Article</hi> of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:103560:82"/>
                     <hi>Faith</hi> upon their Ambiguous Expreſſions. Whereas the Paſſages, which we alledge for <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> are taken from <hi>Catechiſms, Homilies, Sermons,</hi> and familiar Diſcourſes, where the <hi>Fathers</hi> on purpoſe, and as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and Doctors of the <hi>Church,</hi> expound this <hi>Myſtery</hi> to the people, and tell them what they are to believe concerning it. This ſuppos'd:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I anſwer, 1. That <hi>Tertullian</hi> here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted with an <hi>Heretic,</hi> and that, at ſuch a Time, as was neither convenient, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his Prudence, to publiſh the whole Truth concerning this <hi>Myſtery:</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that it is not to be admir'd he ſpoke ſomewhat obſcurely. 2. That by theſe Words; <hi>this is my Body. that is, the Figure of my Body,</hi> he meant the outward Forms, or Accidents of the <hi>Sacrament:</hi> For he knew very well, that the <hi>Sacrament</hi> conſiſted of two things, <hi>viz.</hi> of the outward <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> or <hi>Forms</hi> of Bread and Wine, and of the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> contain'd under theſe <hi>Accidents.</hi> The firſt, <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls the Figure of Chriſt's Body, and ſo do all the R. Catholics at preſent; becauſe theſe outward forms exhibit, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto us the Body and Blood of Chriſt, which they cover. Now this gave <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> a ſignal Advantage over his Antagoniſt, who deny'd, that Chriſt had a Real Body; becauſe it prov'd, that the Sacrament cou'd not be call'd the Figure of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Body, unleſs he had a True and Real Body; and therefore he inſiſted upon it, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring

what was contain'd under that Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure; Which (tho' it may be blameable in a Sermon, or Diſcourſe deſign'd for the Inſtruction of the People, yet) may very well be allow'd in a Diſpute; conſidering the advantage it gave to his Cauſe, on the one ſide, but without prejudice to Truth; and the Scorn, and Contempt it wou'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Chriſtian Religion to, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; had he at that time of day, fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded that <hi>Myſtery.</hi> Now that <hi>Tertullian</hi> did not believe, that the <hi>Sacrament</hi> was a Figure only, with excluſion to the Reality of the Body, and blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is evident from that Paſſage before cited, <hi>non ſciet Maritus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. St. <hi>Auſtin's</hi> Words are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in the ſame ſenſe: For he here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed with <hi>Adimantus</hi> the <hi>Manichean,</hi> who affirm'd that the Soul, or Life of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals conſiſted in their Blood. Now St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to refute this Error, tells him, that the Blood of Animals, in Scripture, is taken for their Life; becauſe it repreſents and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Life. And ſo, ſays he, God calls Blood, Soul or Life; <hi>for our Lord did not doubt to ſay, this is my Body, when he gave the Sign of his Body.</hi> Which words, ſurely, if the compariſon be juſt, muſt ſignifie, that that Sign of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Body, contain'd his true Body; as the blood, which is the Sign of the Soul, or Life in Animals, contains their Life or Soul.</p>
                  <p>But that the Doctor may ſee how far St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was from believing, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:103560:83"/>
was only a Sign or Figure of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Body; I will tranſcribe a paſſage taken out of his <hi>Comments</hi> upon the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> where he ſpeaks plainly and familiarly for the People's Inſtruction. 'Tis upon theſe Words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, adorate Scabellum pedum ejus quoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Sanetum eſt; adore ye his Footſtool becauſe it is holy.</hi> 
                     <q>Behold Brethren, ſays he, what he commands us to adore: The <hi>Scripture</hi> ſaith elſwhere, <hi>Heaven is my Seat, but the Earth is my Footſtool:</hi> He commands us then to adore the Earth; becauſe he ſaid. in another place, that the Earth was God's <hi>Footſtool;</hi> and how ſhall we adore the Earth; ſince the <hi>Scripture</hi> expreſly ſays; <hi>thou ſhalt adore thy Lord thy God?</hi> And this <hi>(Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt)</hi> ſays, <hi>adore ye his Footſtool:</hi> But ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining to me what his Footſtool is, he ſaith: <hi>The Earth is my Footſtool.</hi> I am at a ſtand. I fear to adore the Earth, leſt he ſhou'd damn me, who made Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth. Again I fear, if I do not adore the <hi>Footſtool</hi> of my Lord; becauſe the <hi>Pſalm</hi> ſays to me, <hi>adore ye his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool.</hi> I ask what his <hi>Footſtool</hi> is, and the Scripture tells me: <hi>The Earth is my Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool.</hi> Being in doubt, I turn me to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for 'tis He whom I here ſeek, and I find, how without impiety the Earth may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd. For he took Earth of Earth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe fleſh is of Earth; and he took Fleſh of <hi>Mary</hi>'s Fleſh; and becauſe he here walk'd in that Fleſh, <hi>and gave us that fleſh to eat for our Salvation.</hi> But no Man eats it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he firſt adores it. It is found how
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:103560:84"/>
ſuch a Footſtool of the Lord may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd; and we do not only not ſin, in adoring it, but we ſhou'd ſin if we do not adore it.</q> 
                     <hi>Enar.</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 98.</p>
                  <p>Here St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave us that Fleſh to eat, in which He walk'd here on Earth; and that we are ſo far from ſin, in adoring that Fleſh, that we ſin if we do not adore it. <hi>Chriſt</hi> walk'd here in the fleſh, <hi>and he gave us that fleſh to eat; and we ſhall ſin if we do not adore that fleſh,</hi> ſays this <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> What fleſh did <hi>Chriſt</hi> here walk in? Was it in the <hi>Sign</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> of His Fleſh? No ſure, 'twas in his real Fleſh. 'Tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent then, that Chriſt gave us his Real Fleſh, in this <hi>Father</hi>'s ſenſe. Here St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks plainly, and familiarly to the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; here is no Diſpute in the Caſe, no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to be taken of a Sophiſtical <hi>Heretic;</hi> no fear of expounding the Myſtery to the full: Conſequently he ſpoke his mind plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. In a word; he muſt have loſt his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who does not ſee, that it is from ſuch Paſſages as this, where the Fathers ſpeak to their Flock, and expound the Scriptures, and the Myſteries of our Religion, that we are to Learn, what they hold concerning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Point of <hi>Faith;</hi> and not from ſome Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe, and dark Expreſſions cull'd out of their Diſputes with <hi>Hereties;</hi> where the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> purpoſely deſign to conceal the depth of this <hi>Myſtery,</hi> when ever they muſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it. But the truth of the matter is; the Doctor's Cauſe wou'd afford him no better Arguments, and rather than fail, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to catch at any thing.</p>

                  <p>That theſe Fathers gave the Name of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and nature to the Accidents will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we conſider the Equivocation of the Word <hi>Symbol,</hi> here mention'd by <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret.</hi> This Word is ſomtimes taken for the Bread and Wine it ſelf before Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, and ſomtimes, but moſt properly, for the External Form, and Appearance of Bread and Wine, which remain after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration. <hi>Eraniſtes,</hi> or the <hi>Eutychian Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic</hi> took it in the firſt ſenſe; and therefore affirm'd, that, <hi>as the Symbols after Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration are chang'd into an other thing; ſo the Body of our Lord, after his Aſcenſion, is chang'd into the Divine Subſtance.</hi> This he ſaid of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> becauſe he was ſo taught, and becauſe he knew there was no difference between him, and the <hi>Orthodoxus</hi> on that Subject. But what does the <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxus,</hi> to take advantage by that ſimilitude? Why, he takes the Word Symbol in its more proper meaning, namely for the Accidents, or outward Forms, and tells the <hi>Heretic, he is caught in his own Net; becauſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Myſtical Symbols after Conſecration, do not paſs out of their own Nature; for they remain in their former Subſtance, Figure, and Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and may be ſeen and handled as before.</hi> Now, that by the <hi>Myſtical Symbols,</hi> he meant the Accidents, methinks 'tis plain; for the Reaſon he gives, why theſe Symbols are not chang'd, is, becauſe <hi>they may be ſeen and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:103560:85"/>
handled as before.</hi> But this proves plainly, that he muſt have meant the Accidents; ſince only Accidents can be ſeen and felt. Nor does it move me, that he ſeems to give partly for his Reaſon, that the Subſtance of the Symbols remain; for that is ſaid <hi>gratis,</hi> and cou'd never be prov'd, if he had meant the real Subſtance of the Bread. Beſides, there is nothing more common in human Language, than to give the Denomination of Subſtance to meer Accidents; as we u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually ſay, <hi>the Subſtance of his Diſcourſe was this; the Subſtance of what he ſaid,</hi> &amp;c. tho' all Diſcourſes and Sayings, are pure <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</hi> And however this Solution, at firſt ſight, may ſeem ſtrange; yet, whoever will take the pains to examin well the Sayings of both theſe Diſputants, and believes they were in their Wits, he cannot poſſibly deny what I ſay to be True. The one poſitively affirms of the Symbols, that they are chang'd into an other thing; the other as ſtifly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that they do not change at all. I ask now, whether theſe Symbols are Objects of Senſe, or not? If you ſay they are. I ask again; whether two Men in their Wits, and Senſes, can be ſo miſtaken in a plain Object of Senſe, as to affirm contradictory things of it at once? For inſtance: Can two Men be ſo miſtaken about a white Wall, which they plainly ſee; as that one ſhou'd affirm it is white, and the other, that it is not? 'Tis plain they cannot: 'Tis then manifeſt, that if the Symbols be Objects of Senſe, <hi>Eraniſtes</hi> and <hi>Orthodoxus,</hi> did not both
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:103560:85"/>
conſider them as ſuch; otherwiſe they muſt have loſt their Reaſon, to affirm ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory things of them at once. 'Tis then evident, that <hi>Eraniſtes,</hi> who affirm'd, the Symbols were chang'd, did not conſider them as they are Objects of Senſe; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he muſt have ſpoken contrary to the Evidence of his own Senſes: Conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his meaning was, that the Change hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in the Subſtance of the Bread, and not in the <hi>Accidents.</hi> 'Tis no leſs evident, on the other hand, that <hi>Orthodoxus</hi> conſider'd the Symbols, as Objects of Senſe; elſe he cou'd, with no Colour of Reaſon, affirm, that they did not paſs out of their <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Subſtance,</hi> &amp;c. For, let us ſuppoſe with the Doctor, that he meant the real Subſtance of the Symbols, or Bread and Wine: How does he prove that there is no real Change in them? <hi>Becauſe the Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Symbols,</hi> ſays he, <hi>do not paſs out of their own Nature, for they remain in their former Subſtance,</hi> &amp;c. this is only ſaid, but wants to be be prov'd. Well! How does he prove it? Becauſe, continues he, <hi>they may be ſeen, and handled, as before.</hi> Why this the <hi>Heretic Eraniſtes</hi> acknowledges; and yet he affirms, that the Symbols are chang'd: And, which is more, he therefore believes, that it is the real Subſtance of the Symbols, and not the <hi>Accidents</hi> that are chang'd; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Accidents may be ſeen, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as before. And now, wou'd it not be a very pleaſant way to perſwade him, that the Subſtance of the Bread and Wine was
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:103560:86"/>
not chang'd, for that very Reaſon, for which he believ'd it was? Or let us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that they both conſider'd the Symbols as the true, and real Subſtance of the Bread and Wine, and not as Accidents, or Objects of our <hi>Senſes:</hi> Well! What follows? The <hi>Heretic Era<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>; and then how cou'd the <hi>Orthodoxus</hi> convince him by his own Words, or tell him, he was caught in his own Net; unleſs he cou'd prove to him, that the Symbols taken in that Senſe were not chang'd? But this he is ſo far from doing, that the Reaſon he offers, to evince that he was ſo caught, proves no more, than that the Accidents, or Objects of <hi>Senſe</hi> ſtill remain, namely, that which <hi>may be ſeen and handled;</hi> which the <hi>Hetetic Eraniſtes</hi> never denied. 'Tis then evident, that he underſtood the Word <hi>Symbol</hi> in a different Senſe from that of <hi>Eranistes.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently his meaning muſt have been, that the Accidents, which he calls <hi>Symbols, did not paſs out of their Nature,</hi> &amp;c. And all his Advantage conſiſted in the <hi>Equivocation</hi> of the Word <hi>Symbol,</hi> which his Adverſary took in a vulgar Senſe, and, by that, gave him an Opportunity to perplex him, and tell him he was caught in his own Net. And, God knows, he muſt be hard put to it, who would fain ſqueez Proof for his <hi>Faith</hi> from ſuch intricate Diſputes.</p>
                  <p>I have nothing to add, in anſwer to <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſius</hi> his Paſſage, to what is here ſaid: For

'tis plain from the Scope and Deſign of this <hi>Father,</hi> (who likewiſe diſputed with an <hi>Entychian Heretic</hi>) that he meant, <hi>by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or nature of Bread,</hi> the <hi>Qualities</hi> of it, which (we confeſs) remain ſtill in the Sacrament; nothing being more uſual in common Diſcourſe, than to give the name of <hi>Nature</hi> to the Quality, as we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, a Man of ill nature, that is, of ill Qualities.</p>

                  <p>TO give the Communion in one, or in both kinds, is no matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> but reſpects the Diſcipline of the <hi>Church,</hi> which, according to the different Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and Exigencies of Affairs, for the increaſe of Piety and Devotion; and in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion to the Infirmity of her Children, is often neceſſitated to alter ſome things in her Diſcipline; it being Evident, that what in one Age was good and profitable, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Age will in no wiſe bear. And ſince it is agreed upon, that the care of feeding the <hi>Flock</hi> was committed to the <hi>Church;</hi> that ſhe alone is Commiſſion'd to diſpence the Divine <hi>Mysteries,</hi> and hath a peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to <hi>guide her into all Truth;</hi> none can reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly doubt, but She is the moſt Competent Judge, what in her Diſcipline to change, what to retain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:103560:88"/>Now the main ſtreſs lyes upon this, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no it be in the Power of the <hi>Church</hi> to alter her Diſcipline, in a matter of this Importance, ſo as to reſtrain the Faithful to the receiving of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> in one kind only? It being acknowledg'd by our ſelves, that, in the Primitive Times, this <hi>Sacrament</hi> was indifferently adminiſtred, ſometimes in Both, ſometimes in one kind: Tho 'tis hard to conceive, why Men ſhou'd rather conclude, that it is not in the Power of the <hi>Church</hi> to reſtrain the Faithful to one kind; becauſe the Communion was ſomtimes given in Both, than the contrary, that it is in the Power of the Church ſo to do; becauſe it was likewiſe ſometimes given in one kind? To juſtifie then the conduct of the <hi>Church</hi> in this particular, I ſhall only examin, whether the Receiving of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> in both kinds, be Eſſential to a True, and Real Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Sacrament?</hi> For if both kinds be Eſſential, then 'tis certain, the <hi>Church</hi> cannot take away any Eſſential part of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> without deſtroying the whole; and conſequently in giving but part, wou'd give nothing at all: Therefore cou'd not reſtrain the Faithful to one kind; it being evident, that the Church is only impower'd to diſpenſe, and not to deſtroy the <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys of God.</hi> But if I can make out, that the Participation of the <hi>Euchuriſt,</hi> in Both Kinds, is not Eſſential to the worthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Sacrament, then it will evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow, that the Church may lawfully command the forbearance of one kind. For
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:103560:88"/>
if you ſhou'd ask any of our Learned <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants;</hi> why they do not give the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion at night, or after Supper, or ſitting down, or lying on Couches, as, 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd, Chriſt gave it? They will tell you; becauſe 'tis not Eſſential to the Sacrament to give it ſo. Or why they do not plunge the Children into the Water, when they baptize them; as the Apoſtles, and primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church have done? They anſwer, as before, that it is not Eſſential to the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Lotion of the Soul, that the Body ſhou'd be waſh'd by <hi>Plunging,</hi> rather than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; but that, whether it be perform'd by <hi>Immerſion,</hi> or <hi>Aſperſion,</hi> or in any other manner, 'tis the ſame thing to all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and Purpoſes of the Sacrament: So that it is plain, and even confeſs'd by our Adverſaries, that the Church has Power to alter, and change all the Circumſtances, which are not of the Eſſence, and Nature of the Sacraments. All the Difficulty then conſiſts in this, whether it be Eſſential to the Communion to receive it in both kinds? Or whether One kind be not ſufficient? And if it be made out, that it is not Eſſential to the Communion to receive both; but that it is enough to receive it in One kind; then the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> muſt confeſs, that the Church may lawfully command the Forbearance of the other.</p>
                  <p>Now, that the receiving of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> in Both Kinds, is not Eſſential to the True, and Real Participation of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, to all the Intents, and Purpoſes
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:103560:89"/>
of the Sacrament; but that One Kind alone is ſufficient, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From ſeveral Texts of <hi>Scripture</hi> which affords us ſufficient Grounds to conclude, that for the due Participation of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is not neceſſary to receive it in Both kinds.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the General Practice of the Church in all Ages; even in thoſe days, in which the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do own, the pure Word of God (as they ſpeak) was preach'd, and the Sacraments duely adminiſtred.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From the Conſent of our Adverſaries, if conſiſtent with themſelves. I begin with the firſt.</p>
                  <p>And that our Adverſaries may not think, I deſign to impoſe upon them; I will quote thoſe places of Scripture, that ſeem to make againſt, as well as for me. Chriſt ſays, <hi>John</hi> c. 6. ver. 50. <hi>This is the Bread which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down from Heaven, that a Man may eat thereof, and not die.</hi> Ver. 51. <hi>I am the living Bread which came down from Heaven: If any Man eat of this Bread he ſhall live for ever; and the Bread that I will give is my Fleſh.</hi> Ver. 53. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, except ye eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink His Blood, ye have no Life in you.</hi> Ver. 54. <hi>Who ſo eateth my Fleſh, and drinketh my Blood, hath eternal Life.</hi> Ver. 56. <hi>He that eateth my Fleſh and drinketh my Blood, dwelleth in Me, and I in Him.</hi> Ver. 58. <hi>This is that Bread, which came down from Heaven— he that eateth of this Bread ſhall live for ever.</hi> Here are ſix Paſſages, whereof three ſeem to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:103560:89"/>
be expreſly for the Communion in one kind; and the other three ſeem to be againſt it. What ſhall we ſay to this? Muſt we believe all? Or ſhall we believe but three of them? For they ſeem to contradict one another. One ſays; <hi>Except ye eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, ye have no Life in you.</hi> An other; <hi>If any Man eat of this Bread he ſhall live for ever:</hi> If it be True, that the Man, who <hi>eateth of this Bread ſhall live for ever;</hi> how can it be at the ſame time true, that he cannot live, except he eat the Bread, and drink the Cup? Muſt we then <hi>hold</hi> to three of theſe Paſſages and reject the reſt? As to the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> I do not ſee, how it ſhou'd ſtand with their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to do otherwiſe: For they are ſo far from believing, that the Man, who eats of this Bread ſhall live for ever; that they conſtantly aſſert, that except he drinks alſo of the <hi>Cup,</hi> he is guilty of a Horrid <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vol. 2. pag. 70.</note> 'tis what Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> expreſly affirms. <hi>This is no Addition to Chriſtianity</hi> (ſays he, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Communion in One Kind) <hi>but a ſacrilegious taking away of an Eſſential Part of the Sacrament;</hi> they muſt then neceſſarily deny three of theſe Paſſages, if they be True to their own Principles. But for <hi>R. Catholics,</hi> they are not in the leaſt perplext at this ſeeming Contradiction; they believe them all to be both true in themſelves, and agreeable to their Principles: For they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, that whoſoever eateth of this Bread, the ſame eateth and drinketh the Fleſh and Blood of the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> in the Senſe he
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:103560:90"/>
meant they ſhou'd eat and drink his Fleſh and Blood; which is not to be underſtood (as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> as well as <hi>Catholics</hi> muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, tho' upon different Grounds) in the ſtrict, and proper meaning of the Words, as if eating, and drinking his Fleſh and Blood were to be perform'd by two different Acts, whereof one is converſant about a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, and the other about a liquid Thing, as the Words uſually and properly import; but that to eat, and drink his Fleſh and Blood, ſignifies no more than to participate of, or to take by the Mouth his Fleſh and Blood, whether with one or different Acts it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not. <hi>R. Catholics</hi> then find no Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in reconciling theſe places; they believe the Fleſh of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the Fleſh of a Living Man, which cannot be ſo without Blood; and therefore, when they take it, they are ſure, they eat and drink his Body and Blood; that is, they are Partakers of his Body and Blood. And hence it is, they do moſt certainly conclude, that it is not Eſſential to the Communion to receive it in both Kinds; becauſe they receive in one, all that Chriſt requires of the Faithful to receive, that is, his Body and Blood. I ſay <hi>Proteſtants</hi> as well as Catholics muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that in this Paſſage, <hi>Except ye eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood,</hi> the Words <hi>eat,</hi> and <hi>drink,</hi> are not to be taken in the ſtrict, and uſual Senſe they commonly bear: For ſeeing they believe, that, in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> there is neither Fleſh nor Blood, nothing but Bread and Wine;
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:103560:90"/>
and that in eating and drinking theſe Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the <hi>Letter,</hi> they do eat, and drink the Body and Blood of Chriſt by <hi>Faith,</hi> as it is ſaid in the 39 <hi>Articles,</hi> it cannot be ſaid, that they eat and drink the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, in the literal and uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Senſe of the Words; it being impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to eat and drink in the Elements, in a literal Senſe, that, which, in a literal Senſe, they do not really contain, as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> hold. They muſt then neceſſarily conclude, that to eat and drink the Body and Blood of Chriſt, is not to be underſtood in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral, but in a figurative Senſe; and then the meaning of theſe Words muſt be, <hi>To <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and drink the Body and Blood of Chriſt;</hi> that is, to be Partakers of the Body and Blood of Chriſt; and if ſo, then 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that in eating only the Body of Chriſt, which, being a living Human Body, muſt needs contain his Blood; we eat and drink his Fleſh and Blood, that is, we are made Partakers of his Fleſh and Blood, which ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is all that is requiſite to the Eſſence or Nature of the <hi>Sacrament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, who wou'd believe, that the R. Catholics had ſuch grounds, in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for the Communion in one kind; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the loud, and clamorous accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yea and the <hi>horrible Sacrileges</hi> they are charg'd with, upon this Subject? Well! And who are thoſe, who charge us thus? Why they are Great, and Eminent Men: Great indeed, not only for the Rank, and Station wherein the Powers of this World
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:103560:91"/>
have placed them; but alſo <hi>Great</hi> for their Learning, and other Excellent Endowments. But then, 'tis that they muſt ſo do: The Proteſtant Religion (as all the World knows) was planted in theſe Kingdoms by open Force and Violence. Theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's Predeceſſors poſſeſs'd Themſelves of the Rich Benefices of the Church; and when Men's Intereſt, and Honor, are once engag'd, 'tis hard, if they do not ſtand by them.</p>
                  <p>Now there is no way left to juſtifie theſe Proceedings, but by railing at the Church of Rome, and expoſing her pretended Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions; and therefore 'tis no marvel, they ſhou'd lay theſe, and a great deal more to her charge. But take away theſe Fatal By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſes: Let Benefices be laid a ſide: Let the Riches of the Church be propos'd, as the Reward of Virtue, and Merit; and then we ſhall ſee how many Eyes this will open; then we ſhall ſee the <hi>Scales</hi> fall off, and thoſe, who have been hitherto our Greateſt Perſecutors, become, like St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the moſt Zealous Aſſertors of our Faith and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But this by the way.</p>
                  <p>There is an other Paſſage in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> which favours the Communion in One Kind.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> This <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> tells us, that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> after his Reſurrection, appear'd to two of his Diſciples, as they went to <hi>Emans,</hi> who, adds St. <hi>Luke, conſtrain'd Him to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ide with them; and when he ſate at Meat, He took Bread, and bleſs'd it, and brake and gave to them, and their Eyes were open'd, and they knew him,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:103560:91"/>
and he vaniſh'd out of their ſight.</hi> Now, 'tis certain, that, if this Bread, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> bleſs'd and brake, was the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> we have, at leaſt, one inſtance in which <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf gave the Communion in one kind: For 'tis ſaid, that after he had broke the Bread, and gave it to them, he vaniſh'd out of their ſight. And indeed, it is very hard to conceive how the breaking of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Bread, as 'tis uſually done at Meat, ſhou'd open theſe Diſciples Eyes, ſo as to know him that did it to be <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Beſides, the <hi>breaking</hi> of <hi>Bread,</hi> in the Acts of the Apoſtles, is always underſtood of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: and St. <hi>Chriſoſtom,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtin, venerable Bede,</hi> and <hi>Theophilactus,</hi> in their comments upon this place, teach us, that this Bread, which Chriſt brake, was the <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> which ſurely they wou'd not have done, had there been the leaſt doubt of the lawfulneſs of the Communion in <hi>one kind.</hi> However, becauſe it is not thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted by the univerſal conſent of the Church, I ſhall lay no more weight upon it, than it can reaſonably bear; leaving the Reader to judge, what impreſſion the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of four ſuch Great Men, ſo well read in Antiquity, is apt to make upon an unprejudic'd Mind. I now proceed to ſhew, that the Communion, in Both Kinds, is not <hi>Eſſential</hi> to the <hi>Sacrament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <q>from the general practiſe of the Church in all Ages, even in thoſe days wherein the Proteſtants do confeſs, <hi>the Pure Word of God</hi> was preach'd, and the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:103560:92"/>
Sacraments duly adminiſtred.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do pretend to pay a great deal of Reſpect, and veneration to Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and in all their Debates, and Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies of Religion; whether with Us, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Themſelves, they are willing to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> which they look upon as the Rule and Meaſure of their Faith and Practice. Now, if it appears by the Practice of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> that the Communion was given in One Kind without the other; and that this was neither prohibited by the Governours of the Church, nor found fault with by the People, nor yet wrote againſt by any Man whatſoever; then 'tis but reaſonable to hope, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ingenious <hi>Proteſtant</hi> will eaſily be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that neither the Paſtors, nor the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> did ever believe, that both kinds were Eſſential to the worthy participation of the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> This I ſhall, by God's Aſſiſtance, endeavour to evince from the beſt Records, and the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Witneſſes, and Writers of the Primitive Times.</p>
                  <p>And here I find four ſorts of Communion; the Communion of the Sick, the Communion of Infants, and little Children; the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Private Families, commonly call'd the Domeſtic Communion; and the Public, and Solemn Communion of the Church. And in regard of all theſe, I ſhall undertake to prove, that, for the firſt ſix hundred Years, the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> was given, 1. in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Sick, under the <hi>Species</hi> of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:103560:92"/>
Bread alone. 2. In the Communion of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and little Children, under the ſpecies of Wine alone. 3. In the Domeſtic, or Private Communion, under the ſpecies of Bread; but ſo as to be ſometimes given, tho' ſeldom in both kinds: And laſtly, in the public, and ſolemn Communion of the Church, ſometimes in one, ſometimes in both kinds; as the Piety and Devotion of the People carry'd them to participate of one or Both.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Communion of the Sick-<hi>Euſebius,</hi> One of the Beſt,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hiſt. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.</hi> lib. 6. cap. 44.</note> and moſt Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> gives us an intire Letter of the Great <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onyſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. In this Letter, <hi>Dionyſus</hi> relates the Story of a certain Old Man call'd <hi>Serapion,</hi> who being under Publick Pennance, and falling Sick, ſent a Boy to a Prieſt, that was at ſome diſtance from him, to deſire him to come to him, and give him the ſacred Communion before he had departed this Life; but the Prieſt happening at the ſame time to be ſick, and not able to go ſo far, gave a Piece of the ſacred Bread to the Boy, and order'd him to carry it to <hi>Serapion,</hi> and enjoyn'd him more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over to moiſten it in ſome Liquor, and then to give it to him as his laſt <hi>Viaticum;</hi> which when he had done, ſaith <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> the good Old Man immediately gave up the Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>Here is a Communion in one kind rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a Man, who was as Great a <hi>Saint</hi>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:103560:93"/>
as he was a Biſhop; and Recorded by an other Great, and Learned Biſhop: Both very ancient Witneſſes, both much celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Antiquity: Yet neither the one, nor the other finds any fault with the Prieſt, nor with <hi>Serapion</hi> for this Communion, which our Adverſaries wou'd now abhor as ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious and deteſtable; on the contrary, they both admire the Goodneſs of God, as the ſaid Letter witneſſeth, in ſparing this poor Man's Life 'till he had receiv'd the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Pledge of his Redemption. And now, can it be imagin'd, that theſe two Great Men, who liv'd ſo near the Times of the Apoſtles, and were ſo well inſtructed in the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> ſhou'd not rather be ſurpris'd at the Raſhneſs of the Prieſt, than admire the Mercy of God in this Affair, if the Practice and Diſcipline of the Church had not authoriz'd ſuch a Communion? Nay that <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who was ſo Nice, and Severe in his Remarks, and Cenſures upon the leaſt Slips, and Miſtakes of other Clergymen, ſhou'd be ſilent in a bus'neſs of this Weight, is ſure what no Man can Reaſonably ſuppoſe. This the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> cou'd not but ſee; and therefore the moſt Ingenuous among them, as Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi>

                     </note> and others have free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſs'd, that the Communion here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, was given only in one kind: But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who reſolve to ſay any thing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than acknowledge the Truth, wou'd maintain, that that Liquor wherein the Boy was order'd to moiſten the Piece of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:103560:93"/>
Bread, was the conſecrated Wine; whereas, it is plain from the Words of the Letter, the Prieſt gave him no Liquor at all, but order'd him to ſteep the ſacred Bread in any Liquor he cou'd find at Home. Beſides, ſuppoſe he had dipt the Bread in the ſacred Wine, and gave it ſo to the ſick Man; no Proteſtant, who underſtands the Principles of his Religion, will ſay, that this is to eat, and drink the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, For Proteſtants hold, that it is therefore neceſſary to eat, and drink the Elements apart; becauſe in ſo doing, they ſhew the Death of our Lord, whoſe Body was Broken, and ſeparated from his Blood. But this Evaſion is ſo Vain and Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, that it merits no farther Confutation.</p>
                  <p>An other Inſtance of this Communion, is that of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> We have this Great Biſhop's Life written by <hi>Paulinus</hi> his own Deacon, who was preſent at his Death, and dedicated his Life to St. <hi>Austin,</hi> at whoſe Requeſt he wrote it; ſo that his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is beyond all Exception. This Deacon tells us, that St. <hi>Honoratus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceil,</hi> who came to viſit St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> as he lay on his Death Bed; <hi>Heard, in the dead of the Night, a Voice ſay to him thrice, Ariſe, delay not; for he is going to depart. He came down,</hi> adds <hi>Paulinus, gave him the Body of our Lord, and the Saint no ſooner receiv'd it</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Eoque reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſimé accepto.</note> 
                     <hi>when he gave up the Ghoſt.</hi> Here the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of our Lord is given to St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> but no mention of his Blood: Here 'tis ſaid, he no ſooner receiv'd it when he gave up
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:103560:94"/>
the <hi>Ghoſt.</hi> The word <hi>It</hi> is remarkable; for being of the Singular Number, and denoting only one thing, it cannot be underſtood but of the Body to which it refers; whereas if <hi>Paulinus</hi> had meant, that he had receiv'd the Body and Blood, under both <hi>Species,</hi> he ſhou'd have ſpoken in the Plural Number, and ſaid; he no ſooner receiv'd <hi>them,</hi> when he gave up the Ghoſt. Well, what ſay our Adverſaries to a Deciſion ſo plain? For ſomething muſt be ſaid. Some ſay, St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> receiv'd the Communion as well as he cou'd; being prevented by a ſudden Death before he cou'd receive the <hi>Sacred Cup.</hi> Vain fancy! As if the Divine Power, which ſent a Voice from Heaven to order the Communion to be given to him, cou'd not keep him alive 'till he had receiv'd the Sacrament Intirely. Others, not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with this Anſwer, ſay, St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd both kinds, tho' one only is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, by the Grammatical Figure <hi>Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche,</hi> where a part is taken for the whole. But this is as groundleſs as the former: For, beſides, that the preciſe and expreſs Terms in which that Phraſe is conceiv'd, will admit of no figurative Senſe; ſuch Grammatical Figures are not us'd by any Eccleſiaſtical Writers, when they ſpeak of the Communion; nor did any Proteſtant ever yet inſtance in one ſingle Paſſage wherein it is ſo taken; which is an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Argument that they had none to Inſtance in. I might farther inſtance in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Carthage,</hi> in the Communion of St.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:103560:94"/>
                     <hi>Baſil;</hi> but let this ſuffice for the Communion of the ſick; for I wou'd not be tedious.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Practice we find obſerv'd in the Communion of Infants and little Children, only with this difference, that, whereas the Communion was given to the Sick, under the <hi>Species</hi> of Bread; here it is given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Species Wine. And the Reaſon of this Difference, I conceive was this. In the Begining, whilſt the Church groan'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Tyranny, and Perſecution of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan <hi>Emperors,</hi> and their Magiſtrats; the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> being forc'd to wander from place to place, when they light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any Chriſtians with little Children, or new-born Infants, being uncertain, whether they ſhou'd ever return that way again, they us'd to adminiſter the Sacraments to them; the Biſhops, the Sacraments of <hi>Baptiſm, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,</hi> and the <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> and the Prieſts, the Firſt and the Laſt. And becauſe the new-born Babes were not capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any thing that was ſollid, they gave them always the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> under the Form of Wine. And this Cuſtome, thus ſettled in the firſt Perſecutions, continu'd in the <hi>Church</hi> until the latter end of the Tenth Century; yet all this while it never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into any Man's Head, to ſay, that this was an Imperfect, much leſs a Sacrilegious Communion.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Inſtance we find of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, is in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Time, about the Year of our Lord 240. This holy Martyr tells us what happen'd in his own Preſence
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:103560:95"/>
to a little Girl,<note place="margin">Trat. de Lapſis.</note> who had eaten a little of the Bread, that was offer'd to the Idols. Her Mother knowing nothing of what She had taken, carry'd her, as the cuſtom was, to the place where the Chriſtians were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembl'd. During the the time of Prayer, adds this Father, this Child was troubled, and diſorder'd, as if for want of Words, (which her tender Age was not capable of) ſhe wou'd by this means, declare the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune which befell her. After the uſual ſolemnity, the <hi>Deacon,</hi> who preſented the <hi>ſacred Cup</hi> to the <hi>Faithful,</hi> continues St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> coming to the rank where this Child was; <hi>ſhe turn'd her face aſide, not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bear the preſence of ſuch a Majeſty. She ſhut her Mouth, ſhe refus'd the Cup. But being compell'd to ſwallow ſome drops of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Blood, ſhe was not able,</hi> purſues this Father, <hi>to hold it in her ſullied Entrals, but violently gave it up; ſo great is the Power and Majeſty of our Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is a fact ſo plain, that nothing can be adedd to it; all the Circumſtances of it are attended with ſuch Marks of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in one kind, that nothing but meer Prejudice, or rather Blindneſs, can make any Man doubt it. I know ſome Proteſtants have been ſo vain as to pretend, that this Child did receive the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Deacon came with the ſacred Cup; but this is ſo contrary to St. <hi>Cyprian's</hi> Deſign, in relating this ſurpriſing Story, that I wonder any Man, in his Senſes, ſhou'd ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin it. What, a Child, that eat of the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:103560:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Devils,</hi> is troubled and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (by the Inſtinct, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> doubt, of the <hi>Holy-Ghost,</hi> for Reaſon ſhe was not capable of) becauſe ſhe was to partake of the Cup of our Lord! And wou'd ſhe not, think you, be in the ſame Trouble and Confuſion, were ſhe to receive the Lord's Body? At the preſence of the ſacred Cup, ſhe turns her face aſide, and ſhuts her mouth, and that by divine inſtinct, for Reaſon ſhe had not; her <hi>ſullied Entrals</hi> are not able to bear the <hi>Majeſty of our Lord in his Blood,</hi> but are forc'd to give it up. And wou'd She have done leſs, at the Preſence, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the ſame Lord's Body? Is the Majeſty, or Power of the Lord's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy leſs than that of His Blood, that it ſhou'd not cauſe the like Diſorder? At the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Lord's Blood, here are a great many ſurpriſing Accidents; and why not the like at the Receipt of His Body?

And becauſe theſe
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:103560:96"/>
Holy Aſſemblies cou'd not be very frequent, in the Rage of Perſecutions; nor the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd Chriſtians, who liv'd far off, come eaſily to them; and that the <hi>Species</hi> of the Sacred Wine was apt to be ſoon alter'd, eſpecially in ſo ſmall a quantity, as they muſt have taken it; and beſides, ſubject to other Accidents, which, in thoſe troubleſome Times, they cou'd not well prevent; they were content to carry along with them the Sacred Body of our Lord, under the Form of Bread only; being perſwaded, that when they eat of this Bread, they were Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, and of the <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Sanctification</hi> thereunto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd. And here I ſhou'd tire the Readers Patience, ſhou'd I bring all, that can be ſaid in Confirmation of this Truth; but I ſhall inſtance only in ſome few of the beſt, and moſt approv'd <hi>Authors;</hi> for I perceive I have been longer upon this Subject than I deſign'd. <hi>Tertullian,</hi> a Learned Author of the <hi>ſecond Century</hi> ſpeaks thus of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Communion,</hi> in the Book, which he wrote to his Wife to diſwade her from marrying after his Death. <hi>Thy Husband</hi> (ſays he) <hi>will not know that, which thou ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt before all other meat, and if he ſhou'd, he will think it is Bread, and not what it is call'd;</hi> that is, the Body of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Here <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us, that his Wife, after the manner of other Chriſtian Women, us'd to take a certain Thing, before ſhe taſted any other Food; and that her future Husband, whom he ſuppoſes a <hi>Pagan,</hi> if he ſhou'd
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:103560:97"/>
know it, wou'd think it to be Bread; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was ſo in Appearance, tho' in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality it was the Body of Chriſt; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Form of Bread, and no other.</p>
                  <p>The great St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> a Greek Father of the <hi>fourth Century,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 289.</note> delivers this Practice more at large in his Letter to <hi>Ceſaria,</hi> who, it ſeems, wou'd know, whether it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to receive the Communion otherwiſe, than by the Hands of a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> or <hi>Deacon.</hi> To which He anſwers thus; <hi>As to this, that it is not grievous to take the Communion with one's own Hands, when there is no Prieſt nor Deacon preſent, being forc'd thereunto in Time of Perſecution, 'tis needleſs to tell you; becauſe it has been confirm'd by long <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and Cuſtom: For all thoſe, who lead ſolitary Lives in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts, where no Prieſts are, keep the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in their Houſes, and communicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Beſides, in</hi> Alexandria <hi>and in</hi> Egypt, <hi>all the People do commonly keep the Communion at home; for when the Prieſt conſecrates the Hoſt, and diſtributes it; we may reaſonably believe, they partake of it, and carry it with them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I need not go about to prove, that this Communion was nothing elſe but the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Bread; for 'tis plain, St. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſpeaks only of that which is touch'd with the hand. Beſides, 'tis certain he cou'd not mean the <hi>Sacred Cup,</hi> when he ſpeaks of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the <hi>Deſarts;</hi> it being evident, that the <hi>Species</hi> of Wine cou'd not be preſerv'd, for any time, in ſo ſmall a Quantity, as they muſt have taken it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:103560:97"/>St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> gives us much ſuch an other Account of this Communion: He tells us, how his Brother <hi>Satyrus</hi> was miraculouſly ſay'd from drowning,<note place="margin">de Obit. Satyr.</note> by the Faith he had in the <hi>Sacred Hoſt.</hi> For being in a Storm, where all were given for loſt, he begg'd of one of the Chriſtians, who were aboard, to give him a piece of the <hi>Sacred Bread</hi> which he had; and having, by the Earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Prayers, obtain'd that Favour, <hi>he wrapt this Divine Sacrament</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Ambroſe) in a Cloath, and ty'd it about his Neck,</hi> (for being a <hi>Cathecumen</hi> only, he wou'd not eat it) <hi>caſt himſelf into the Sea;</hi> and God, to recompenſe the Greatneſs of his Faith, brought him ſafe from that boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Element. Here you ſee the Chriſtians, agreeably to what St. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith, us'd to carry the <hi>Sacred Bread</hi> about them, that they may eat of it, in Caſe of any Hazard or Danger: But of this enough.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Public and ſolemn Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church; I own we have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances from <hi>Fathers or Eccleſiaſtical Writers,</hi> for the <hi>firſt four Centuries</hi> to prove, that the Communion was publickly given, in one kind, to any, except Infants and little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; nor can our Adverſaries inſtance in any, who ſays it was not ſo given: And ſo far we are upon the Level. But me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks (the Scales being thus even) the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and Cuſtom of the Church, expreſly Recorded and Deliver'd by the Writers, and <hi>Liturgies</hi> of the <hi>Fifth, Sixth,</hi> and all other ſucceeding Ages, in Favour of the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:103560:98"/>
public Communion in one, as well as in both kinds, ought to weigh down the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, and determin any reaſonable Man to conclude, that this ſame Practice was deriv'd from the foregoing Ages.</p>
                  <p>We find, indeed, in the latter End of the fifth Age, a <hi>Decree</hi> of Pope <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> which forbids certain People to receive the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in one kind; but if we attend to the Motives and Circumſtances of this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,</hi> and to the Perſons there meant, we ſhall find, it is ſo far from deſtroying our <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> that it plainly confirms it. What gave Occaſion to it was this: In the Time of St. <hi>Leo,</hi> Pope <hi>Gelaſius</hi> his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, there were a great many <hi>Manichees</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> who, the better to ſpread their wicked Errors, feign'd themſelves <hi>Catholics,</hi> and frequented the Churches and Sacraments like others; but it being part of their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that Wine was created by the <hi>Devil,</hi> and that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did not ſpill his Blood for us; but that his Paſſion was Fantaſtick, not Real, they abhorr'd Wine above all things, and therefore abſtain'd from the <hi>Sacred Cup</hi> in the Communion.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Leo</hi> complains of the Diſorders, which they caus'd in the Church; He declaims a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their wicked and helliſh Devices; He tells us, they were ſo bold, as to preſume to mix themſelves with the Faithful, and receive the Lord's Body, but abſtain'd from the <hi>Sacred Cup;</hi> and gives that, as a Mark to diſcern them by. But becauſe the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful were at Liberty to take <hi>One,</hi> or <hi>both
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:103560:98"/>
Kinds,</hi> and that many devont Chriſtians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the <hi>Body,</hi> without the <hi>Sacred Cup;</hi> it was hard to find out by that Mark, who theſe <hi>Manichees</hi> were. However, St. <hi>Leo</hi> did not think fit to alter the Diſcipline of the Church, nor take away their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the Faithful; but was content to inſinuate, that whoſoever ſhou'd refuſe to take the <hi>Sacred Cup,</hi> as abhorring Wine, or in Deteſtation to the Blood of Chriſt, ſhou'd be reputed of that Sect. But this Remedy proving ineffectual, Pope <hi>Gelaſius</hi> was forc'd to Decree, that whoſoever abſtain'd from the <hi>Sacred Cup,</hi> upon any ſuch ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pretence, ſhou'd be altogether depriv'd of the Communion. It may not be amiſs to ſubjoin his very Words:<note place="margin">Gr. Diſt. 2 can. comper. de conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat.</note> 
                     <hi>We have found out, that ſome People do take, only the Body, and abſtain from the Sacred Blood, who, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are engag'd in I know not what Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, muſt either take both parts, or be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>'d of both; becauſe the Diviſion of one, and the ſame Myſtery, cannot be done without great Sacriledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, to give you my Thoughts upon this <hi>Decree;</hi> I think it is plain,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that there was no need of making ſuch a <hi>Decree,</hi> if all the Catholics, in thoſe days, had receiv'd the Communion in both kinds: For this being made, on purpoſe, to diſcover the <hi>Manichees,</hi> who never drank Wine, there was nothing ſo eaſie as to find out, who they were, upon their refuſal of the <hi>Sacred Cup;</hi> conſequently there needed no <hi>Decree</hi> to diſcover them. But ſince it
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:103560:99"/>
is confeſs'd, that theſe <hi>Heretics</hi> did mix themſelves with the <hi>Catholics,</hi> and receiv'd the Communion only in one kind, and that notwithſtanding all St. <hi>Leo's</hi> Care, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to find them out, they were ſtill undiſcover'd; I think it is a Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ſome Catholics, as well as the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichecs,</hi> did receive the Communion in <hi>One Kind</hi> only. And this being all that I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to evince, I might now take leave of this Decree. But I ſhall obſerve,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that the prohibition here made affects only thoſe, who were engag'd in a certain Superſtition; <hi>who, ſeeing they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in I know not what Superſtition, muſt either take both parts, or be depriv'd of both:</hi> For the Reaſon why they are to be depriv'd of both parts of the Sacrament, unleſs they take both, is becauſe they were engag'd in a certain ſuperſtition, which tended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of our Redmption, by the Belief they had, that <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Blood was only an Illuſion; and to divide that <hi>Myſtery,</hi> which, <hi>Gelaſius</hi> ſays, cannot be done without great <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> by the like wicked opinion, that Wine being created by the <hi>Devil,</hi> Chriſt wou'd never have inſtituted the Memorial of his paſſion in that Liquor Whence 'tis evident, that the Catholics, who were in no manner engag'd in theſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Errors, are nothing concern'd in this <hi>Decree;</hi> nor barr'd of the liberty, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had of receiving the Sacrament in <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>both kinds,</hi> as ſuited beſt with their Devotion. And this is ſo true, that we find
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:103560:99"/>
the practice of it recommended by a Canon of a very <hi>Famous,</hi> if not <hi>General Council,</hi> held in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in the <hi>ſixth Century,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Can. 52.</note> known to the Ancients, by the Name of <hi>Concilium Trullanum.</hi> This Council confirms the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cuſtom of the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> which was to celebrate <hi>Maſs</hi> in Lent only on <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi> and <hi>Sundays;</hi> it being by the Ancients Judg'd improper to conſecrate on any of thoſe Days, on which they faſted; becauſe they wou'd not (as they commonly ſpeak) mix the ſolemnity of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> with the ſadneſs of the <hi>Fast.</hi> But on theſe two days, in which they did not faſt, they us'd to conſecrate, and reſerve as much of the ſacred Oblation, as wou'd ſuffice for the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and Laity to take every day, till the Saturday following; and this they call'd the <hi>Maſs of the Preſanctified,</hi> than which nothing is more frequently mention'd in the <hi>Greek Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, to know what was offer'd, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed to the People in this Maſs: All the Ancient <hi>Greek Liturgies</hi> tell us, that there was nothing reſerv'd, but the <hi>ſacred Bread;</hi> that this <hi>Bread</hi> was carried in <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,</hi> from the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> into the <hi>Church;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eucho. Goar. Bib. P. P. Paris, T. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> expos'd to be ador'd by the People, and, after ſome Ceremony, diſtributed to all the Faithful. So that here is a Public, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Communion given in <hi>One Kind,</hi> for five Days every Week Yearly, while Lent holds. But this Practice was not peculiar to the <hi>Greek;</hi> for we find it as early, and as ſolemnly us'd in the <hi>Latin Church.</hi> The

                     <hi>Hugo de Sancto Victore,</hi> and other Writers of the <hi>Eleventh Century.</hi> They tell us, that, on <hi>Good-Friday,</hi> there was no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration made; but that the Body of our Lord, which was conſecrated the day before, was reſerv'd for that day's Communion; that the <hi>Prieſt</hi> took the Lord's Body, and ſome unconſecrated Wine and Water, and then gave the Communion to the People, under the Form of Bread alone. So that there has been a perpetual Practice in the Latin Church, of giving the Communion, in one kind ſolemnly once every Year, both to Clergy and Laity, even to this very Time.</p>
                  <p>I might, further, bring the Authority of <hi>Sozomenus, Evagrius,</hi> Authors of the ſixth Century, and of ſeveral Great, and Learned Men of the Gallican Church, to confirm this Practice; but I think it is ſufficiently evident from what is ſaid, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion was publicly giv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>That to take the Communion, in <hi>both kinds,</hi> is not <hi>Eſſential</hi> to the Sacrament, from the

Conſent of our Adverſaries, if conſiſtent with Themſelves.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe <hi>Martin Luther's</hi> Opinion in this Matter, is of no ſmall Authority; for 'tis but reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that thoſe, who have follow'd the <hi>Scheme,</hi> which he drew, ſhou'd pay their juſt tribute of Reſpect to his Opinion in this Point. Let us then hear him ſpeak. <hi>If any Council</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſhou'd chance to Decree</hi> (the Communion in both kinds) <hi>we ſhou'd by no means make uſe of Both,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De Miffa Ang.</note> 
                     <hi>nay, we wou'd ſooner, in contempt of the Council, take one, or neither, than both; and curſe thoſe, who ſhou'd, by the Authority of ſuch a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, make uſe of both kinds.</hi> Here, I think, it is very plain, <hi>Luther</hi> was of opinion, that both kinds was not eſſential to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, elſe, ſurely, he wou'd not have ſaid, <hi>that he wou'd ſooner make uſe of neither, than of both;</hi> nor <hi>curſe thoſe, who ſhou'd take both kinds.</hi> But the Diſcipline of the <hi>French Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> will afford us a more ample Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in this Matter.</p>
                  <p>In a Synod held in <hi>Potiers, Anno.</hi> 1560. and in an other, in <hi>Rochel,</hi> 1571. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that thoſe, who cannot drink Wine, may receive the Communion under the Form of Bread. It may not be amiſs to ſubjoin their very Words, as they are read in the 12th. <hi>Chapter</hi> of their Diſcipline, <hi>Tit. Of the Lord's Sup. Art.</hi> 7. <hi>The Bread of the Lord's Supper ought to be adminiſter'd to thoſe, who cannot drink Wine, upon their making Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, that it is not out of Contempt; and upon their endeavouring, what they can, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:103560:101"/>
all Scandal, even by approaching the Cup, as neer their Mouths, as they are able.</hi> Now 'tis not to be imagin'd, that theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhou'd think <hi>both kinds eſſential</hi> to the Communion, and yet make ſuch a <hi>Deciſion:</hi> For there is no Body, who is never ſo little Read in <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> but knows, that the <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> of Things is <hi>indiviſible;</hi> that, by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating one <hi>eſſential</hi> Part from the other, you deſtroy the nature of the whole; that in giving only an <hi>eſſential</hi> part of a thing, you give nothing, in regard of that, whoſe <hi>eſſential</hi> part it was; conſequently he that gives but part of the Sacrament, gives no Sacrament at all: Therefore theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who knew better Things, in ordering the Bread alone to be given to thoſe, who cou'd not drink Wine, cannot, in Reaſon, be ſuppos'd to believe, that the <hi>Cup</hi> was <hi>Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> to the Communion; elſe they wou'd have abſolutely refus'd the Sacrament to thoſe, who cou'd not receive it in both kinds; ſince to give it in one kind, were to give nothing at all, but rather to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, and abuſe that, which is moſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and Auguſt in the <hi>Chriſtian Religion;</hi> whereas the natural diſability of thoſe, who cannot drink Wine, might reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them from taking either kind. And thus I have endeavour'd, as briefly as I cou'd, to prove from the practice and diſcipline of the Church in all Ages; from public, as well as private Communion; from <hi>Liturgies, Fathers</hi> and <hi>Hiſtorians;</hi> and even from the conſent of our Adverſaries, manifeſtly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd

in their Diſcipline, and Practice; that neither the <hi>Primitive</hi> Chriſtians, nor the Catholic Church, in any Age; nor yet any <hi>Orthodox Believer</hi> did ever think, that to take the Sacrament in <hi>both kinds,</hi> was <hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> to the Communion. And if ſo, then it is plain and evident, that the Church hath Power to, and may lawfully, reſtrain the Faithful from the Cup, and confine them to <hi>One kind</hi> only. Let us now ſee what Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> objects to all this.</p>
                  <p>And here I ſhall not abuſe the Reader's Patience, by repeating the ſame thing over again; for, ſince all that can, with any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Reaſon, be objected, is contain'd in one ſhort Paragraph (tho' the things there inſiſted on are often repeated in ſeveral of his Sermons, but with no material Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) I will only tranſcribe it, and offer my Exceptions to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And then (ſays he) the Communion, in <hi>One kind,</hi> is plainly contrary to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Inſtitution in <hi>both kinds;</hi> as they themſelves acknowledge. And therefore the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Conſtance</hi> being ſenſible of this, was forc'd to decree it with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs <hi>non Obſtante</hi> to the Inſtitution of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Practice of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and the <hi>Primitive Church.</hi> And their Doctrine of <hi>Concomitancy</hi> (as if the Blood were in the Fleſh, and together with it) will not help the matter; becauſe, in the Sacrament, <hi>Chriſt's,</hi> Body is repreſented as broken, and pierc'd, and exhauſted, and drain'd of his Blood; and his Blood is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:103560:102"/>
as ſhed and poured out; ſo that one kind can by no means contain and exhibit both.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Three things the Doctor here inſiſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 1. That We our ſelves acknowledg the the Communion in one kind to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our Saviour's Inſtitution. 2. That the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Conſtance</hi> was forc'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree it with a <hi>non obſtante</hi> to the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 3. That the Doctrine of <hi>Concomitancy</hi> will not help the matter; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, in the Sacrament, <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Body is repreſented as broken, and exhauſted, and drain'd of His Blood.</p>
                  <p>I may ſay, of theſe <hi>three Propoſitions;</hi> the firſt is neither True, nor to the purpoſe. The ſecond is ſomething to the Purpoſe, but not True. The third is like the firſt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther True, nor to the Purpoſe. I begin with the firſt:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>We our ſelves acknowledge, that the Communion in one Kind is contrary to our Saviour's Inſtitution.</q> For my own part, I have read, at leaſt, ſome of the beſt R. Catholic Caſuiſts and Divines, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Subject; and have convers'd with many more. Yet I declare, I neither read, nor heard any of them ſay, that to give the Communion in one kind, was contrary to our Saviour's Inſtitution; nay, I think, all <hi>R. Catholics</hi> do believe, that the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Communion, whether in one, or both kinds, is quite an other thing from the Inſtitution of it. We ſay, indeed, that when Chriſt inſtituted the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of his
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:103560:102"/>
Body and Blood, He conſecrated not in <hi>One,</hi> but in <hi>both Kinds;</hi> becauſe He deſign'd to leave theſe <hi>Symbols</hi> to his <hi>Church,</hi> as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual and everlaſting Memorial of His Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy broken; and Blood ſhed upon the Croſs, which is expreſs'd by the Separation of one Symbol from t'other; and this, I hope, we are careful to do, as often as we offer that Sacrifice: But to eat or partake of the Sacrifice it ſelf, in one, or both kinds, is, ſure, no part of the Inſtitution, but belongs to the <hi>Modus,</hi> or manner of adminiſtring it.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt inſtituted the Sacraments of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, Confirmation,</hi> and <hi>Matrimony;</hi> yet we do not find, that ever he gave, or admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred any of theſe Sacraments to any Body; which, ſurely, he wou'd not have omitted, were it any part of their Inſtitution: 'Tis then plain, that to give the Communion in <hi>One,</hi> or <hi>both kinds,</hi> is neither for, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Saviour's Inſtitution, but reſpects meerly Adminiſtration and Uſe. But let us ſuppoſe with the Doctor, that to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Communion in <hi>One kind,</hi> is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (I do not ſay to Chriſt's Inſtitution, for that it cannot be, but) to the manner in which our Saviour gave it; yet ſtill I do not ſee how this can help the matter: For the Queſtion is not whether Chriſt gave it in both kinds, but whether we ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to give it in both kinds; becauſe he did ſo? This the Doctor affirms, and we deny. But how does He prove it? Why, becauſe Chriſt gave it in both kinds. This
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:103560:103"/>
is begging the Quſtion: Well, becauſe Chriſt gave it in both kinds, we ought to do ſo too: This is to ſay, (if it be to purpoſe) that we are bound to do all thoſe things, that Chriſt did, at the inſtitution and adminiſtration of the Communion. If ſo; then we muſt fall to waſh the Diſciples Feet, to eat <hi>Suppers</hi> before the Sacrament, to adminiſter the Communion at Night; and (which is more ſtrange) we muſt command all thoſe to whom we give the Communion, to do the ſame thing we do, that is, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate and adminiſter the Sacrament, and conſequently make them all Prieſts; all theſe things, I ſay, we are bound to do: For Chriſt did all, and every particular here mention'd to all thoſe, to whom he gave the Communion in <hi>both kinds.</hi> But ſince neither He, nor any Man in his Wits will ſay, that we are bound to do all theſe Things; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Diſcipline and Practice of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the Living Members of it have determin'd, that all thoſe particulars are now neither Neceſſary, nor Expedient, I hope he will give us leave to conclude, that we are not bound, to give the Communion in both kinds neither.</p>
                  <p>Touching the <hi>ſecond Propoſition,</hi> 
                     <q>The <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Conſtance</hi> was forc'd to decree it with a <hi>Non obſtante</hi> to the Inſtitution of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Doctor is not the only Man, who affirms this; for I find it in the Works of one, or two more of his Brethren, upon this Subject. But Good God! What may
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:103560:103"/>
not Men undertake, who have the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to give out ſuch Calumnies for Truth? 'Tis a vulgar Obſervation, but a True one, that when <hi>Mountebanks</hi> pretend moſt to infallible Cures, they are then furtheſt from them; juſt ſo 'tis with theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen (for there are <hi>Mountebanks</hi> in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as well as in Phyſick) when they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend moſt to Evidence and Demonſtration, in matters of Religion, then they have the leaſt Colour, or reaſonable Pretence to it. But the beſt way to refute this Calumny, is to cite the very Words of the Council; and then let the Reader judge what <hi>Faith</hi> is to be given to Men, who vend ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures for Truth.</p>

                  <p>This is all, in this <hi>Decree,</hi> that has any Relation to the Dr's. <hi>Non obſtante.</hi> And now, I appeal to the moſt partial of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, whether he had the leaſt Colour, or Pretence to what he here ſuggeſts? There is, indeed, a <hi>Non obſtante</hi> to the making of this Sacrament after Supper, and giving it to thoſe, who were not faſting, and no more: And if this be a ſin, ſure, he is not qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to throw the firſt Stone at us for it: For he, and his Brethren, are confeſſedly involv'd in the ſame Crime; ſeeing they do not make the Sacrament after Supper, nor give it (to the beſt of their knowledge) to any, but ſuch as are faſting.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>third Propoſition:</hi> 
                     <q>The Doctrine of <hi>Concomitancy</hi> will not help the matter; becauſe in the Sacrament, <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Body is repreſented as broken, and exhauſted, and drain'd of his Blood.</q> Hence the Doctor infers, that the Sacred Bread, which repreſents his Body under theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, cannot be ſaid to contain, or exhibit his Blood. But methinks he ſhou'd have prov'd his <hi>Poſtulatum,</hi> before he wou'd perſwade us of the Truth of this Inference: For, I ſuppoſe, he was too well acquainted with us, to think we ſhou'd believe it, upon his Word. That our bleſſed Lord ſhed a great deal of His <hi>Precious Blood,</hi> as much as was ſufficient for the Redemption of Mankind, we readily grant; but that His Body
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:103560:104"/>
was exhauſted, and drain'd of His Blood, ſo as to have none at all left in it, we can by no means aſſent to. If <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Body had been drain'd of His Blood, He wou'd have died of Weakneſs, and Loſs of Blood; but the <hi>Centurion,</hi> who, it ſeems, was a better Naturaliſt than the Doctor, thought quite otherwiſe: For he concluded from the Force and Vigour, wherewith our Bleſſed Lord gave up the Ghoſt, that he was the Son of God; <hi>Vere Filius Dei erat iſte.</hi> Nor will it avail the Doctor, that, when the Souldier pierc'd his ſide with a Spear, there came out Blood and Water: For Chriſt being then dead, and the Blood, as <hi>Anatomiſts,</hi> and Experience teach us, being, by the laſt motion of the Heart, convey'd from the Arteries into the Veins, where it ſtands ſtill, when there is no more Circulation; it is impoſſible to conceive, how all the Blood in his Body ſhou'd come out of his Side, eſpecially in the Poſture he then lay in: So that that, which the Doctor wou'd have us take for granted, has no Degree of Truth in it. Well, but ſuppoſe we ſhou'd grant, that Chriſt's Body was exhauſted, and drain'd of his Blood; will this deſtroy the Doctrine of <hi>Concomitancy?</hi> by no means: For ſince we believe, that under the <hi>Species</hi> of Bread, is really, or (as his own Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm ſays) <hi>verily</hi> and <hi>indeed,</hi> contain'd the Body of Chriſt, which (being now a human li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Body) muſt neceſſarily have Blood in it; though we ſhou'd ſuppoſe it had none when it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ead; we have all the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:103560:105"/>
in the World to believe, that when we take the Lord's Body, we do, at the ſame time, by <hi>Concomitancy,</hi> that is, together with it, take the Blood which it contains. So that, tho' it were true, that the Body of <hi>Christ</hi> was exhauſted, and drain'd of his Blood, in his Paſſion; yet it wou'd not at all prejudice our Doctrine of <hi>Concomitancy,</hi> nor make any thing for the Doctor's Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>But, you will ſay: If the Communion, in <hi>One Kind,</hi> be ſufficient; If it contains the Body and Blood of Chriſt; why did the Chriſtians heretofore ſometimes receive it in both kinds? I anſwer, becauſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the Death of our Lord is more fully expreſs'd in <hi>both kinds,</hi> than in <hi>One.</hi> But then we muſt conſider, that this Repreſentation is not of that Importance, as to ballance all the weighty Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that mov'd the Church to command the uſe only of <hi>One kind.</hi> We have the Death of our Lord ſufficiently repreſented to us, when we take the Communion in <hi>One kind;</hi> becauſe we believe, and are put in mind, that it is the Fleſh and Blood of our Lord, which we receive in Remembrance of his Death and Paſſion; and we have this Repreſentation fully expreſs'd in the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Maſs, where his Body and Blood are ſhewn <hi>Myſtically</hi> ſeparated under diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Forms; and that, almoſt, as often as we receive the Communion. So that there is nothing wanting in our Communion to give us a lively Repreſentation of the Death
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:103560:105"/>
and Paſſion of our Bleſſed Lord; and if there were, 'tis not of that moment, as to make amends for the Horrid Prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Abuſes, which muſt inevitably attend the Communion in <hi>both kinds,</hi> in a degenerate Age, in which all Piety and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs are almoſt extinguiſht; and whereof we have ſad Inſtances in our Adverſaries Practice, it being frequently boaſted by many of their <hi>Libertins,</hi> that after hard drinking over Night, they come in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to receive the Communion, and drink off whole <hi>Communion-Cups</hi> of conſecrated Wine, to quench their brutiſh Thirſt. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Manner of adminiſtring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> at preſent, which our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries do alſo follow and practice; tho' very different from that of the primitive Church, doth ſufficiently juſtifie our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in this Particular.</p>
                  <p>'Tis certain, that the <hi>Regeneration</hi> of the <hi>Faithful</hi> is more lively expreſs'd, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by <hi>Immerſion,</hi> or plunging into the Water, as the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> did always Baptize, than by <hi>Infuſion</hi> or <hi>Aſperſion</hi> as we now do: For the <hi>Faithful,</hi> being plung'd into the Water of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi>

Moreover, when the <hi>Faithful</hi> is immers'd or dip'd into the Water, or Four, where
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:103560:106"/>
all the Parts of the Body are waſh'd, this Lotion does more fully expreſs the cleanſing of the Soul from all its ſins, than if one part only had been waſh'd: Yet no body doubts, but that the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> conferr'd by <hi>Infuſion,</hi> or ſprinkling of Water upon one Part only of the Body, is ſufficient to all the Intents and Purpoſes of the Sacrament; becauſe the main thing is there repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, namely, the waſhing of the Soul. So that it is enough to expreſs the Myſtery as to the Subſtance, and the Effect, and the Grace that is annex'd to it; and not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouſly to inquire after every minute-Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of it, eſpecially when there are weighty Reaſons and Motives, to diſwade us from it.</p>
                  <p>In like manner, tho' we do not ſo fully repreſent the Death of our Lord, when we take the Communion in <hi>One kind,</hi> as we ſhou'd by taking it in Both; yet we are perſwaded, that there is nothing (<hi>Eſſential</hi> to the Sacrament) wanting to it; becauſe we do both expreſs and receive the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the Effect, and the Grace of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; that is, the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the ſpiritual Food of our Souls, and that ſtrict Union with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which (as he himſelf ſaith) maketh <hi>us dwell in Him, and Him in us.</hi> And if the Church did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the Laity the Uſe of the <hi>Sacred Cup,</hi> 'twas not with an Intent to rob them of any thing, that might tend to increaſe their Devotion, as our Adverſaries do moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly ſuggeſt; but in Reſpect to the Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:103560:106"/>
Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for which, ſurely, we cannot have too much Veneration. She ſaw, that, as the Piety and Devotion of the people diminiſh'd, ſo their Negligence to receive the ſacred Cup, in ſuch a manner as may ſecure it from ſpilling, abounded. She found by Experience, that many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and Old, and even Folks in perfect Health, what with coughing, or other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, as they receiv'd the Sacred Cup, gave up their Stomacks into the <hi>Chalice,</hi> or ſhed the Precious Blood, to the great Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the Spectators, and their own great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Confuſion; that others, what with tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and quaking, did very often, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their care, ſpill ſome Drops of the Sacred Blood; in fine, that in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, where ſome thouſands uſe to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate at a time, Crouds of People preſſing upon the Prieſt, have ſometimes ſpilt the <hi>Sacred Chalice</hi> in his Hands; and (which I cannot mention without Horror) Trod upon that Precious Blood, by which they were Redeem'd. Theſe and the like Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations mov'd the <hi>Church,</hi> or rather the People (for the Church did only confirm the Cuſtom, which was introduc'd for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years before) to abſtain from the Sacred Cup; and to content themſelves with the Body and Blood of Chriſt, under the Form of Bread, which is eaſily receiv'd with due Reſpect, and without Danger; and to which nothing is wanting, only a more full Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the <hi>Myſtery,</hi> which yet is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd by other means, and which (in the

                     <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Years of many Generations; Ask thy Father, and he will ſhew thee; thy Elders, and they will tell thee.</hi> 'Tis certain, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven acknowledg'd by our Averſaries, that when the Chriſtian Religion was firſt Preach'd in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> every Country had then, as well as now, its own peculiar Language dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the Latin; which (tho' it was cultivated by Men of Letters and Bus'neſs, in all Countrys to which the Romans exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their Conqueſt, yet) the common people, or <hi>Natives,</hi> were generally Ignorant of: And 'tis no leſs Evident, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Apoſtolical Men, who preach'd, and Propagated the Chriſtian Religion in theſe Countrys, were endued with a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of working Miracles in Confirmation of the Truth of it; and by their readineſs to lay down their Lives, and to ſhed their Blood for it, gave ſufficient Teſtimony of their Zeal and Charity for the common People, as well as for the great Ones; yet all the Records of Antiquity, all the Ancient and Modern <hi>Liturgies,</hi> together with the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:103560:108"/>
Univerſal Tradition of the <hi>Western Church,</hi> and even the Conſent of our Adverſaries; all theſe, I ſay, bear witneſs, that neither the Apoſtles, nor the Apoſtolical Men, who firſt planted the <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> in theſe Parts, nor any ſucceeding Generation of Catholics, did ever uſe in the public Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of the Church, any other Language than the Latin; which, 'tis confeſs'd, the common People, Generally Speaking of all Countries (except <hi>Italy</hi>) are, and have always been Ignorant of. And therefore, I think we may very ſafely tred in the ſteps of theſe our Holy Anceſtors, and be content with the <hi>Liturgy</hi> and Language, they left us; at leaſt, if we muſt be condemn'd for ſo doing, we have the comfort to be condemn'd in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with theſe Great and Holy Men, to whoſe Doctrine and Practice, God Himſelf was pleas'd to put His Seal.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt make uſe of this Language, becauſe we conceive it very neceſſary to have an Uniformity, as much as is poſſible, both in Faith and Practice, that we may with one Heart, and one Tongue, Praiſe the Lord, and Magnifie His holy Name.</p>
                  <p>The Catholic Church is <hi>One</hi> in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as well as in <hi>Faith.</hi> Now, how much one common Tongue, in which the public Service of the Church is perform'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to foment this Union, the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Diſtractions and Diviſions of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Reformers,</hi> who have as many different Religions, as they have different Tongues, do but too manifeſtly Evince. All the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:103560:108"/>
of the Catholic Religion ought to have Communion, and Fellowſhip one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: They ſhou'd all be united in one common Faith, and one uniform Worſhip of one God; they ought all to be qualified for the Participation of the ſame Sacrament, and to aſſiſt together at the ſame Public Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service wherever they meet; elſe, how can the Unity of their Faith and Communion ſubſiſt? Now, 'tis hard, to conceive, how all this can be perform'd, if we have our Liturgy, in as many different Tongues, as there are Countrys in the Catholic Church: For how can I have fellowſhip with a Man whoſe Language I do not underſtand? How can I joyn in Prayer, or in God's public Worſhip with any Society of People, when I cannot diſcern by any thing they do or ſay, whether they are <hi>Catholics,</hi> or <hi>Heretics?</hi> Or how ſhall I receive the Sacrament in the Society of thoſe, who, for any thing I can ſee or underſtand, may be <hi>Jews,</hi> or Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of my Holy Religion? So that if we take away that Common Band, that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Language, that unites, and Cements all the Members of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> myſtical Body, the whole Frame of the Catholic Church will diſſolve and falls to Pieces; and we ſhall have as many different Churches, as we have Tongues.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We do not ſee what great loſs the Common People ſuffer by not having the <hi>Liturgy</hi> in vulgar Tongues; and if we had, we are ſure the good, that might acrew to them by having it ſo, is not ſo valuable as
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:103560:109"/>
to be purchas'd at the Expence of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Union, and Peace of the whole <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Church,</hi> which, as experience ſhews, is neceſſarily conſequent upon ſuch an Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. The moſt Part of the common People are taught, at leaſt, to read in their own Language; and if we except ſome of the Commonality of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the <hi>Highlands</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who are induſtriouſly barr'd all ſort of Education; there is not one in a hundred, even of the meaneſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort, who want this Help. And then they have the whole <hi>Maſs,</hi> the <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> and <hi>Goſpels,</hi> and <hi>Collects</hi> of all the <hi>Sundays</hi> in the Year, together with all the <hi>Pſalms</hi> in vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Languages, in their Prayer-books; which they may read to themſelves in their own Tongue, whilſt the Prieſt reads them, in Latin; and which no doubt, contributes more to their Edification, than if the Prieſt had ſpoke in their own Tongue; conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that in Catholic Countries, where ſome Thouſands are aſſembled, it is not poſſible for the hundreth part of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to hear what is ſaid, in what ever Language he ſpeaks. Add, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the <hi>Maſs</hi> is pronounc'd ſo low, that ſcarce any, that is preſent, hears what is ſaid; the <hi>Rubric</hi> ſo commanding, that the Prieſt may, in the Silence of Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and Meditation, be the better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to perform the Office in that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> and <hi>Adorable Myſtery,</hi> with the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and Decency that becomes it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, on all <hi>Sundays,</hi> and great Feſtivals
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:103560:109"/>
throughout the Year, there are, in Catholic Countries, public Sermons and Exhortations perform'd in Vulgar Language; yea, and public Prayers read in the Pulpit, either before or after the Sermon, in which the people are inſtructed in their Duty to God and their Neighbours; and excited to do Works of Charity, to forgive their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and to repent of their Sins; to pray for the King and his Magiſtrats, and for one onother: In a word, in which all the Duties and Obligations of a Chriſtian are duly inculcated; and all this, I am ſure, they are, at leaſt, in the Countries where I have been, as careful to perform, as they are to ſay the <hi>Maſs.</hi> So that (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what Proteſtants ſay) all the Difference between them and us, in this particular, is, that we do in vulgar Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage very near all, that they do; and, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and above, give the people an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of adoring <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and of quickning their Memory by the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his Death and Paſſion, which is perform'd in the <hi>Latin Maſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, (If there were no other Reaſons) the Difficulty of tranſlating the <hi>Liturgy</hi> into vulgar Languages, and preſerving it, in its purity, is enough to diſwade us from the Undertaking. The uniformity of our <hi>Liturgy</hi> is the beſt ſtanding Monument we have of the Faith and Practice of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors: 'Tis it that ſhews us, how they us'd to adminiſter the Sacraments, and what ſort of Ceremonies they judg'd moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:103560:110"/>
to excite, and ſtir up Devotion; and to perform God's Service with that Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and Decency ſuitable to His Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Now, if this Liturgie were tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into all the Vulgar Languages, which Catholics uſe, and which is ſo much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Alteration and Corruption, even to that degree, that what is ſpoken in one Age, is ſcarce underſtood in an other; at leaſt, is ſo nauſeous and grateing, that none but the meaner ſort of People will hear it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſguſt; What endleſs Labour wou'd it prove to be thus every Age modeling, and reforming, and changing our Liturgies? What Confuſion and Diſorders wou'd the Unskilfulneſs, or the Fancy of Tranſlators occaſion? Nay, what Tumults and Uproars wou'd ſuch frequent Alterations create both in Church and State; whilſt ſome (to uſe King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. his Phraſe) ſtood up for their Old <hi>Mumpſimus,</hi> and others for their New <hi>Sumpſimus,</hi> is not eaſily Imagin'd.

                     </hi> in <hi>France,</hi> made uſe of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot's</hi> Tranſlation of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and Sung them in their <hi>Temples,</hi> (as the French call them) for a conſiderable Time; but ſome of their Learned <hi>Miniſters,</hi> finding that this <hi>Tranſlation</hi> was not agreeable to the <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> nor even to decency and good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; but, on the contrary, was full of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, lew'd, and prophane expreſſions,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:103560:110"/>
reſolv'd to give the People a better, and more perfect Tranſlation. Now what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions and diviſions this laſt created among the Brethren, whoever is curious to know, may conſult the Writers of thoſe Times. Again, The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, is the beſt (becauſe the leaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd) of the Proteſtant Party, Tranſlated the Scripture, Compos'd a new <hi>Ordinal,</hi> and a ſet Form of Prayer in Vulgar Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, in <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's Time; but theſe being found in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>James's</hi> Days, (if we believe their own Writers) deficient in many things, and in others not agreeable to the then Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, which was not, as yet, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly lick'd into Shape and Form, other new Tranſlations are undertaken; but how much confuſion and trouble theſe alſo oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd, the ſaid Writers can beſt inform us. Farther, The Church of <hi>England</hi> is the Richeſt, and (if we may judge by their Works) the moſt Charitable of all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; yet there paſs'd a hundred Years of the Reign of <hi>Proteſtaniſm</hi> before the <hi>Welſh</hi> were provided of a <hi>Liturgy</hi> in their own Language; tho' moſt of the common People of that Country do not underſtand any other Tongue. And to this day, they have not furniſh'd the <hi>Iriſh</hi> with a <hi>Liturgy</hi> in their own Language, tho' many thouſands in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in the <hi>High-lands</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> go to <hi>Church,</hi> which yet underſtand nothing but the <hi>Iriſh Tongue.</hi> So that it is no ſuch eaſie matter to furniſh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:103560:111"/>
the Subjects of one Crown with <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies</hi> in their own Language. Now, if it be ſo difficult to ſupply a few People with <hi>Liturgies</hi> in their own Tongue, and ſo hard to contain them in their Duty, when the ſaid <hi>Liturgies</hi> muſt be alter'd; Who can imagin all the Difficulties that wou'd at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the attempt, ſhou'd the Catholic Church propoſe to tranſlate her <hi>Liturgy</hi> into all the ſeveral Languages us'd in Europe? Or who can conceive, how it were poſſible for her to keep an Uniformity in Practice and Ceremony, or to contain the People in their Duty, if ſhe muſt change her <hi>Liturgy</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hundred Years or leſs, and ſpeak a new Language?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Gentry,</hi> and Better ſort of People can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide to have their Ears grated with Obſolete, Antick Expreſſions; and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People, who think the Subſtance chang'd with the Words, will not part with their old <hi>Mumpſimus.</hi> And then, what fine work wou'd this make! <hi>Marot,</hi> in one of his <hi>Pſalms,</hi> gives us this Ridiculous Phraſe; <hi>I will caſt my Slipper at him.</hi> The common People, who minded only the Rime and Gingle of the Words, no ſooner under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that this Phraſe was alter'd, tho' in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for the better; when they were ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd upon the matter, that the Miniſters were like to have (not ſlippers but) ſticks, and ſtones, and ſuch Arms, as a popular Fury adminiſter'd, caſt at them. And what, do you think, ſhou'd happen in in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> where there are
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:103560:111"/>
ſo many different Languages; ſo many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Humours, ſo hard to be ſatisfied; ſo many uncouth, unpoliſh'd people, ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be govern'd; ſhou'd ſhe undertake to give them the <hi>Liturgy</hi> in their own Tongues, and continue, changing and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſame, as often as the Languages change. Truly for my part, as I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that the Deſign is as vain, as it is needleſs; ſo I may reaſonably preſume, the Holy Catholic Church will never attempt it. And thus I have endeavour'd to touch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome of the Reaſons, that mov'd the Church in all Ages, to hold to one Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Language, which is always the ſame, not ſubject to Alteration or Corruption, no more than the Faith and Religion which it teacheth; nor leſs Pure and Perfect now, than it was ſeventeen hundred Years ſince. And, ſurely, ſuch a Language, ſo lofty, in its Expreſſions; ſo beautiful and Majeſtie, in its Numbers; ſo Energic and Expreſſive, in its Senſe; and, as I may ſay, ſo immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and indefectible, in its Duration; is the fitteſt to have the public, and ſolemn Service of the Immortal, and Eternal God perform'd in it. And in this, methinks, we do but what the Light of Nature teacheth all Nations; and what our Adverſaries cou'd not but ſee, wou'd they but deveſt Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their Prejudices.</p>
                  <p>'Tis well known, the <hi>Jews</hi> loſt their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tongue in the Capativity of <hi>Babylon;</hi> yet they never read the <hi>Law of Moſes,</hi> or the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> in their public Prayers, from
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:103560:112"/>
that Time to This, in any other Language than the Hebrew; tho' (if we except their Rabbins) very few, if any, of that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on underſtand any thing of it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Grecians</hi> have long ſince corrupted their Language, as all the World knows; and the common People among them know no more of the Genuine <hi>Greek,</hi> than ours do of the Latin; yet the <hi>Greek Church</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver chang'd a Syllable in their <hi>Liturgy;</hi> but do ſtill ſay their <hi>Maſs</hi> in the ſame Pure <hi>Greek,</hi> which was us'd when they firſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd the Chriſtian Faith. All other Sects of Chriſtians,<note place="margin">See Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s Critical Hiſtory of the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</note> in the Earſtern Churches, have likewiſe Corrupted their Languages; yet, they continue to Celebrate Divine Service in the Languages they firſt us'd; tho' the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion People do not underſtand them. And (if I may be allow'd to borrow an inſtance from <hi>Infidels</hi>) the <hi>Turks</hi> ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>Arabic Language</hi> in their <hi>Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron;</hi> nor did they ever permit it to be read in any other Tongue, in their public Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; tho' 'tis confeſs'd their common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple underſtand it not. But of this enough. Let us now ſee what the Doctor objects to this Point.</p>
                  <p>And here I do not intend to purſue him in all the Repetitions, He makes of the ſame thing, without any material Addition; for then I ſhou'd tranſcribe ſeveral, almoſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Sermons; but ſhall for the Reader's eaſe, and my own, bring all his Real, or Apparent Difficulties within the compaſs of theſe few Heads.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, <q>That to pray in an <hi>unknown Tongue</hi> is contrary to St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Doctrine, who has no leſs than a whole Chapter wherein he confutes and condemns this Practice.</q>

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <q>That the <hi>Scripture</hi> being,<note place="margin">Vol. 1. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit poſt obit pag. 264.</note> by our own Confeſſion, a principal Part of the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> it cannot be imagin'd, how People ſhou'd ſquare, or meaſure their <hi>Faith</hi> by this <hi>Ride,</hi> unleſs they are allow'd to read and underſtand it.</q>

                     <q>That we therefore look up the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in an <hi>unknown Tongue;</hi> becauſe it is certain, that if the People were once brought to underſtand the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> they wou'd ſoon quit our Religion, and go over
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:103560:113"/>
to them.</q> This is the Sum of what he ſays upon this Subject, to which I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn my Exceptions as plainly, and briefly as I can.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he ſaith, <q>That the celebrating of Divine Service in an <hi>unknown Tongue</hi> is contrary to the Practice of the Primitive Church.</q> I anſwer, if he means, by <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Tongue,</hi> ſuch a Tongue as no body un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands; it is very True, but not to the purpoſe: For the Tongue, in which we ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate divine Service, is not ſuch, but, on the contrary, the Tongue in the World, I believe, the beſt known. But if he means by it, a Tongue unknown to moſt of the common people, his Aſſertion has no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Truth in it: For, firſt, he himſelf acknowledges, and ſo doth all Mankind, that the Primitive Church, and all ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Generations (I mean in the Latin Church) till the Reformation appear'd, did celebrate divine Service in the ſame Latin Tongue we now uſe. And ſecondly, even Malice it ſelf cannot deny but that, generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, all the common people, (except the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>) were always Ignorant of the Latin Tongue. 'Tis then manifeſt, our Conduct in this particular is altogether conformable to the Practice of the primitive Church; and then the Doctor is out in his firſt At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. This he cou'd not but ſee, and therefore in an other place he endeavours to Inſinuate (tho' he durſt not ſpeak it out) that the common people ſpoke all Latin.<note place="margin">Vol. 3. pag. 469.</note> But this only ſhews what the Wit of Man
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:103560:113"/>
is capable of, when he muſt, and will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a thing. What, the common people of <hi>Spain, France, Germany, Sweden, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, Norway, England, Ireland, Scotland,</hi> &amp;c. ſpoke all Latin! 'Tis indeed confeſs'd, all theſe People were in Communion with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> all receiv'd their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Liturgy</hi> from her; all celebrated di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service in the ſame Tongue, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner with her; but that they all ſpoke and underſtood the <hi>Roman,</hi> or <hi>Latin Tongue,</hi> is, ſurely, ſo ridiculouſly abſurd, that I rather believe, I miſtook his meaning, than that a Man of his Parts ſhou'd be guilty of ſo great a Miſtake.</p>
                  <p>As to what he ſays, that Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip (being a reaſonable Service) ought to be directed by our Underſtandings, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with our Hearts and Affections, I readily agree with him: And for that Reaſon, I hope, we are as careful to teach the common People their prayers in their own Tongue, and to exhort them to ſay 'em in the ſame Tongue, as our Neighbours: Yet this notwithſtanding, it did not ſeem good to the Holy Spirit of God, who guides his Church into all Truth, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into all good Practices, to alter that Tongue, which venerable Antiquity, and a Preſcription of now almoſt ſeventeen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years, have conſecrated to His divine Worſhip. The Reaſons whereof I have partly touch'd upon before.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Chapter the Doctor here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to, is the 14th of the firſt to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> which, had it been faithfully tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated either from their own <hi>Greek,</hi> or our <hi>Latin;</hi> wou'd leave no Room for this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. The Queſtion is, whether St. <hi>Paul</hi> condemns public prayers in a Tongue, which all the common people do not underſtand? This the Doctor affirms, and vouches the Authority of the <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation</hi> in the aforeſaid Chapter, where St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as he ſays, condemns Prayers in an <hi>unknown Tongue.</hi> We ſay, firſt, St. <hi>Paul</hi> has no ſuch thing as <hi>unknown Tongue;</hi> but the word, <hi>

Secondly, St. <hi>Paul</hi> does not condemn ſpeaking or pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>with Tongues,</hi> which is the only thing there mention'd. And both theſe we are able to make appear; the firſt, from their own <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> in which (tho' they give it to us in their Sermons, and Diſputes for currant Scripture, yet) they put the word, <hi>

                     <hi>Tongues</hi> is commended, the ſame Word is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, <hi>with Tongues,</hi> which in the former Verſes muſt ſignifie <hi>unknown Tongue.</hi> And thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> is made to ſpeak what theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen pleaſe.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknown</hi> ſeems to make for them, it muſt be inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but when it is againſt them, it muſt be left out. Well, but what are theſe <hi>Tongues</hi> whereof St. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaks? And why does he hold forth to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſo long upon upon this Argument.</p>
                  <p>I Anſwer. 1. St. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaks of thoſe Extraordinary and Surpriſing <hi>Tongues</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the firſt Believers were inſpir'd, by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which was Pour'd down upon them, as appears from ſeveral places in the Acts of the Apoſtles, where 'tis ſaid; <hi>The Holy Ghoſt fell upon them— and they ſpake with Tongues.</hi> Secondly, St. <hi>Paul</hi> holds forth to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſo long upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in order to give ſome cautions concerning theſe <hi>Tongues.</hi> He know, that ſuch Extraordinary Tongues were intended rather as a Sign to the Unbelievers, than for the Inſtruction of the Faithful. He foreſaw, the ſaid Tongues wou'd occaſion a great deal of Confuſion and Diſorder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Chriſtians, if all thoſe, who were inſpir'd with them, were allow'd to riſe up, and ſpeak all at once; and that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the Goſpel wou'd be very much retarded, if ſuch Proceedings were not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated. Therefore he inſtructs the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> in what they were to do upon this Occaſion: He tells them, that tho' he wou'd
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:103560:115"/>
have them all ſpeaks with Tongues; yet that he had rather they ſhou'd Propheſie; and upon this Argument he takes up more than half the Chapter, to enforce the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Propheſying more than of Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Tongues.</hi> But that if they wou'd ſpeak with Tongues, he deſires it ſhou'd be done <hi>by two, or at moſt by three, and that by courſe.</hi> And now let even the moſt partial of our Adverſaries judge, whether there be any thing in all this, which doth, in the leaſt, inſinuate, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> condemns pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſpeaking with Tongues; nay, doth not he poſitively ſay; <hi>that he wou'd have them all ſpeak with Tongues;</hi>

                     </gap> the Trouble of going any farther for it. Touching, <hi>Spain, Germany, Italy,</hi> and other Catholic Countries; the Enquiry is not very difficult, whether they have the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in vulgar Languages: For we may eaſily meet with Men of Credit and Probility out of theſe Countries, who can aſſure us, they have the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in their Native <hi>Tongues.</hi> So that it is hard to imagin, what ſhou'd put him upon aſſerting a thing ſo bare-fac'd, and deſtitute of the leaſt colour of Truth; and ſo peremptorily affirming what the Evidence of our Eyes and Ears, and even daily Experience, can ſo eaſily contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict.</p>
                  <p>I know, He, and Others of his Mind, do vouch the <hi>Decree</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi>
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:103560:116"/>
concerning Prohibited Books, for what they ſay; and found all the Railing Accuſations they bring againſt the <hi>R. Catholics</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon: Which is as much as to ſay, that, tho' we have the <hi>Bible</hi> in all <hi>Vulgar Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,</hi> and ſee, and read it in the ſame <hi>Languages;</hi> yet we muſt believe it is lockt up in an <hi>unknown Tongue,</hi> which we do not underſtand; becauſe theſe Gentlemen will have it, that the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> hath ſo decreed. But, beſides that it is a hard Caſe to which theſe Gentlemen wou'd reduce us, <hi>viz.</hi> that we muſt not believe what we ſee, feel, hear, and underſtand; contrary to their own Ordinary Rule; the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> does not in the leaſt favour their Pretenſion. I ſhall ſubjoin the very Words of that Council, and leave it to ſpeak for it ſelf. <q>Since Experience ſheweth, that,<note place="margin">Cum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtumſit ſi Sacra Biblia vulgari lingua paſſim ſine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimne permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantur, plus inde, ob Hominum temeritatem, detrimenti quam utilitatis oriri; hac in parte, Judicio Epiſcopi aut Inquiſitoris ſtetur: ut cum conſilio Patochi vel Confeſſarij Bibliorum a Catholicis authoribus verlorum lectionem in vulgari lingua eis concedere poſſint, quos intellexerint ex hujuſmodi lectione non damnum, ſed fidei atque pietatis augmentum capere poſſe: quam fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultatem in ſcriptis habeant.

                     <hi>De lib. prob. Reg.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>Hence I think it is plain, the Council is ſo far from locking up the Scripture in an <hi>unknown Tongue,</hi> that it gives free Leave to every one, whom the Biſhop, or Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor, with the Advice of the <hi>Pariſh prieſt,</hi> or <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> ſhall judge meet to read it in vulgar Language. And ſince there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo proper, nor ſo powerful to increaſe <hi>Faith</hi> and Piety, in a Meek and Humble Soul, as the <hi>Sacred Scripture;</hi> 'tis plain, that no ſincere Chriſtian is barr'd, by this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,</hi> from the uſe of it in vulgar Language. And if any ſuch ſhou'd happen to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd leave to read it, which we have no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuppoſe; 'tis contrary to the Spirit, and Intention of the Council, who orders that Perſons ſo diſpos'd, may have the free uſe of them. And however this (no great) Reſtraint was neceſſary in thoſe Days, when Mens minds were in a Ferment, and the Itch of Novelty had ſeiz'd them, as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly happens when any new Opinions are broach'd; yet, when they began to ſee with their own Eyes, and became more Still and Calm, the <hi>Governors</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> were ſo far from hindring them the uſe of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> or putting this <hi>Decree</hi> in execution, that they exhort all Perſons to Read and Meditate upon them, as the moſt effectual means to bring them acquainted with the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:103560:117"/>
Will of God, and their Duty to Him. And now methinks, Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> and his Party are, of all Others, the unfitteſt to reproach us this Conduct; conſidering that moſt of the Learned Men of his Church do ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly own, that the promiſcuous uſe of the <hi>Scripture</hi> allow'd to all ſorts of Perſons, and their private Interpretations thereof, was, in a great meaſure, the cauſe of all the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Sects, that ſprung up, and divided themſelves from their Communion.</p>
                  <p>As to what he ſays, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> exhorts the <hi>Jews</hi> to ſearch the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> that St. <hi>Luke</hi> commends the <hi>Ber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:103560:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of confutation and diſorder; ſuch as was that of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> when ſo many were gapeing after Novelty, and ſetting up for Heads of new <hi>Sects,</hi> to moderate the Uſe and Reading of thoſe Sacred Writings: But ſtill ſo as not to ſhut up the Fountain of Life, nor hinder all Good and Virtuous Chriſtians to drink of that Living-Water; which (tho' little) Reſtraint was yet by Degrees abated, as Men began to entertain <hi>Thoughts of Peace,</hi> and Quiet; and, in a few Years after, was inſenſibly taken away in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Countries, by a <hi>Tacit</hi> Admiſſion of the Reading of <hi>Scripture</hi> in vulgar Languages to all ſorts of people. And this I am ſure no Body can juſtly deny to be the Caſe of the R. Catholic Church in regard of the preſent Debate; which how agreeable to Senſe and Reaſon, and to the Piety and Care of a Tender Mother, let even the moſt Inveterate of our Adverſaries judge.</p>
                  <p>Touching the fourth, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>It cannot be imagin'd how people ſhou'd ſquare, or meaſure their Faith by this Rule, unleſs they were allow'd to Read and Underſtand it.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Anſwer to this Objection, is ſufficiently imply'd in what I ſpoke to the former: I ſhall therefore add theſe few Words only; That the Word of God is the Rule of our Faith, but whether it be convey'd to us by Writing, or by Word of Mouth; methinks the <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelf declares in favour of the latter: For Chriſt our Lord, as the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> ſay, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:103560:118"/>
his Diſciples to go and preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; but we do not find, that He gave any Injunction about giving his Word in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the people, in order to learn their Faith. However, ſince it is confeſs'd, that the <hi>Sacred Scriptures</hi> are excellent Means to edifie our <hi>Faith,</hi> and compoſe our <hi>Manners;</hi> we do earneſtly and heartily recommend them to the Study and Meditation of the People.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the laſt, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>That we therefore lock up the Scripture in an <hi>unknown Tongue;</hi> becauſe it is certain, that if the common people were once brought to underſtand the <hi>Scripture,</hi> they wou'd ſoon quit us, and go over to them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Propoſition is falſe in all its Circumſtances. 1. That we do not lock up the Scripture in an <hi>unknown Tongue,</hi> is already prov'd. 2. That the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wou'd not quit our Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will eaſily appear, if we conſider, that, by the ſame Rule, our <hi>Scholars,</hi> and Men of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who underſtand the Scripture in that Language, which they call <hi>unknown,</hi> ſhou'd have quitted us, which he well knew, they do not. Men of Breeding and Senſe, are leſs apt to be pleas'd with Superſtition and Error, than the common ordinary People; and we cannot ſuppoſe, they ſhou'd have leſs Regard for the good of their Souls, than ordinary people; and yet, ſince thoſe Men from whom we cannot, if we wou'd, conceal any thing in our <hi>Faith</hi> or Practice, do not go over to them, but perſiſt in
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:103560:119"/>
our Communion; I think I may reaſonable conclude, that the common people wou'd do the ſame were they never ſo well read in the Scriptures; unleſs we ſuppoſe, that the Proteſtant Religion has ſome Virtue to attract the common people, upon the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Scripture, in a vulgar Tongue, which is incommunicable to Men of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters when they read the ſame.</p>
                  <p>But, methinks, the ſtand the Proteſtant Religion has been at, now upwards of an hundred Years, without gaining one Foot of Ground; nay, hardly, keeping what it had, notwithſtanding, all the liberty and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence it gives to Fleſh and Blood, is an evident Argument, that it was not a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Meditation and Study of Scripture; but rather a popular fury, and ſomething like madneſs, that brought over ſo many of the common People to embrace it in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining. And indeed, if the Fences, and <hi>Bulworks,</hi> wherewith the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is fortified, were taken away; if the <hi>Teſts,</hi> and <hi>Penal-Laws,</hi> and other grievous Burdens laid upon R.

not permitted to bear any Civil, or Military Office; nay, ſcarce allow'd, in ſome Countries, to exerciſe ſuch honeſt Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Callings, as may enable them to get their Bread; if all theſe fatal Engins, I ſay, were laid aſide, and every Man left to chuſe his Religion, without the hopes of Reward, on the one ſide, or the Fear of loſs of Goods and Temporal Puniſhment on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; I doubt, the Proteſtant Religion wou'd ſoon fall to pieces, and many a <hi>Prodigal Child</hi> wou'd return to their Father's Houſes, whence they have ſo long ſtray'd. But theſe Fences, and Barriers (ſhall I call them) of Religion, being ſo Rivetted, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven with the Temporal Laws, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of moſt Governments, where the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> ſways; I fear, all Reaſons and Arguments, tho' never ſo Evident, are too weak to encounter them; unleſs God of His Mercy be pleas'd to put His Hand to the Work: To whoſe infinit Goodneſs and Mercy, I do from my Heart moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly recommend it.</p>

                  <p>Here it may be expected, I ſhou'd give a <hi>Specimen</hi> of his Laborious Endeavours in this matter; but I think a Pattern wou'd not do, and therefore I ſhall refer the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to three intire Sermons,<note place="margin">Vol. 2. edit poſt obit. Ser. 2, 3, 4.</note> where this Bus'neſs is handled to ſome purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Now to juſtifie our Proceedings from theſe imputations, and to ſhew the Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:103560:120"/>
of this Practice, as by us us'd; I ſhall do theſe Four Things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I will endeavour to ſhew, that to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate the Saints, by which Words we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and declare (and 'tis hard if we may not be allow'd to interpret our own Words) that we mean nothing elſe, but to deſire them to pray for us; is not repugnant to the Word of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. that in the public and ſolemn Service of the Church, (excepting the <hi>Litanies</hi> of the Saints, which are read, or ſung ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly four times a Year; the General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Sins, in the begining of the Maſs, a few <hi>Hymns, Anthems</hi> and <hi>Verſicles,</hi> which are not Prayers ſtrictly and properly ſo call'd; and moſt of which are read only once a Year, excepting theſe I ſay) we put up no Prayers to Saints, or Angels; but all our Prayers are addreſs'd to Almighty God, and to Jeſus Chriſt our Mediator and Redeemer. Not but that we hold it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, even in the public, and ſolemn Service of the Church, to pray to the <hi>Saints,</hi> that is, to deſire them to pray for us; ſince all the Addreſſes we make to the <hi>Saints,</hi> do finally Terminate in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in virtue of whoſe Death and Paſſion, we believe the <hi>Saints</hi> are enabled to pray for us; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is matter of Fact, that we do not addreſs our Prayers in the ſolemn Service of the Church, but to God alone.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I will make it appear from the very Words of the <hi>Holy Fathers,</hi> that the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of praying to Saints, was us'd in the Primitive Church. And</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:103560:121"/>Laſtly, I ſhall endeavour to return a brief Anſwer to what the Dr. thought fit to bring againſt this Point.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I will endeavour to ſhew, that to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate the Saints, or (which is the ſame thing) to deſire them to pray for us; is not repugnant to the Word of God. The Texts of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which ſeems to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Practice, and which the Doctor urges, are taken out of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5. where he ſays; <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and Men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And again, Heb. 9.15. <hi>For this Cauſe, He</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>is the Mediator of the New Teſtament,</hi> &amp;c. Hence the Doctor concludes, that it is contrary to the Word of God, and (which he moſtly inſiſts upon) derogatory to the Mediatorſhip of Jeſus Chriſt, to pray to any Saint, or Angel; ſince to do ſo, were to conſtitute them Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators between God and Men, contrary to the Expreſs Words of St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, ſure he was not aware how far this Inference wou'd carry him, elſe he wou'd be a little more reſerv'd. We are exhorted by the Scriptures, and by the Rules of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, we are bound to pray to God for one another:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.19. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.</note> Yea, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf deſires the <hi>Epheſians</hi> to pray for him, and exhorts <hi>Timothy</hi> to have Prayers, and Supplications put up for all Men. Do not we then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute one another Mediators between God and our ſelves? Does not <hi>St. Paul</hi> make the <hi>Epheſians</hi> Mediators between God and himſelf? Moſt certainly, as much as we make
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:103560:121"/>
the <hi>Saints;</hi> for we only deſire the Saints to pray for us, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> deſir'd the <hi>Epheſians</hi> to pray for him; and we deſire every Day the ſame thing of our Brethren. And do theſe Mediators derogate from the Mediatorſhip of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> God forbid! Ay but, ſays the Doctor, the <hi>Saints</hi> are in Heaven, and theſe Men were on Earth: Well, and does their being Preſent, or Abſent, their being in Heaven, or on Earth, make them the more or leſs Mediators, when they are made ſuch, or do the Office of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators? Is any Man the leſs a Mediator, who ſues for the Pardon of an other; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is preſent, or in the ſame Town, or Country with him, for whom he ſues? Sure <hi>there is not</hi> (to uſe the Doctor's own Phraſe) <hi>a Controverſie of Scripture againſt Scripture, or of Reaſon againſt Reaſon; but of down right Imp</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe againſt Tranſub.</hi> Vol. 3. p 299.</note>— <hi>againſt the plain meaning of Scripture, and all the Senſe and Reaſon of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:</hi> I forbear that uncivil Word; the Reader may find it at Length with the Dr. in the place pointed at in the Margin. Well! But the <hi>Saints</hi> are in Heaven. What then? Why, if we deſire them to pray for us, we make them Mediators. But do not the Saints in Heaven pray for us? Yes, the Dr. grants they do:<note place="margin">Vol. 2. 2. edit. obit. pag. 93.</note> They make themſelves Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators then. No, ſays he, <hi>they are not Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators and Interceſſors properly ſo call'd; for</hi> (continues He) <hi>all Interceſſion, ſtrictly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo call'd, is in virtue of a Sacrifice of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd by him that intercedes.</hi> Here He pulls down all that He built before, and juſtifies
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:103560:122"/>
our Practice, as fully as we cou'd deſire. <hi>All Interceſſion ſtrictly and properly ſo call'd, is in virtue of a Sacrifice offer'd by him that intercedes:</hi> Say you ſo! Why then the <hi>Saints</hi> can by no means be <hi>Mediators,</hi> or <hi>Interceſſors</hi> properly ſo call'd, whether we deſire them to pray for us, or they do it of themſelves; ſince they did not offer any Sacrifice by virtue whereof they may, in a ſtrict and proper ſenſe, be called <hi>Mediators,</hi> or <hi>Interceſſors;</hi> and then we may deſire them to pray for us, or they may do it of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and yet be no <hi>Mediators,</hi> or <hi>Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors;</hi> and conſequently not derogate from the <hi>Mediatorſhip</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And thus the Doctor has very judiciouſly, and, in my Opinion, very truly interpreted <hi>St. Paul's</hi> Words, and juſtified us into the bargain.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <q>That in the public and ſolemnly Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Church, excepting the <hi>Lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, &amp;c.</hi> as aforeſaid, we put up no Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to Saints, or Angels; but all our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are addreſs'd to Almighty God, and to Jeſus Chriſt, our only Saviour and Redeemer.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This will appear by a thoro' Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Books, wherein the public Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of our Church is contain'd; which are the <hi>Maſs-book,</hi> and the <hi>Breviary;</hi> the firſt, containing the ſolemn Service of the <hi>Maſs;</hi> and the latter, the <hi>Canonical Office,</hi> namely <hi>Matins, Hours, Even-ſong,</hi> and <hi>Compline.</hi> And here I can in truth aver, that I have
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:103560:122"/>
read both theſe Books, at leaſt ten Times; yet, excepting the <hi>Litanies,</hi> the general Confeſſion, ſome few <hi>Hymns, Anthems</hi> and <hi>Verſicles;</hi> whereof, one or two are read in the <hi>Breviary</hi> on the Feaſts of B V. <hi>Mary,</hi> and other Saints; which yet are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Prayers, and which only mention theſe Words, (<hi>Pray for us, intercede for us,</hi> or the like) I do profeſs I do not know one ſingle Prayer appointed for the public, and ſolemn Service of the Church, in either of them addreſs'd directly to either <hi>Saint,</hi> or Angel, or the <hi>B. V. Mary.</hi> As for the Maſs-book, which is the public <hi>Liturgy</hi> of the Church, excepting the General Confeſſion, there is not one Prayer in it adereſs'd to any but God-Almighty; no, not on the Feaſts of Saints, or of the B. V. <hi>Mary;</hi> no, nor in the Book at all, excepting this one Verſicle, (which is, I think, four times read) <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God, intercede for us.</hi> Which yet is ſeldom read in any public and ſolemn Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Church; and one ſingle <hi>Anthem</hi> wherein the like Words are found on the Feaſt of St. <hi>Michael.</hi> And for the Truth of all this, I appeal to the Books themſelves. There is indeed a Little Office of the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> annex'd to the <hi>Breviary,</hi> wherein the aforeſaid Words, <hi>Pray for us, intercede for us;</hi> or the like, are ſome nine, or ten times repeated in <hi>Hymns, Anthems,</hi> and <hi>Verſicles;</hi> but this being read neither Publicly, nor Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately in the <hi>Church Service,</hi> cannot Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably be ſaid to pertain to it.</p>

Catholics</hi> who never do. Beſides, there is nothing in the <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> but the very Words of Scripture, except theſe laſt, <hi>pray for us now and in the Hour of our Death;</hi> and if it be a good thing to deſire the Mother of God to pray for us, ſure, the oftner we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it, the better it is. As to the Diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between the <hi>Pater Nosters,</hi> and the <hi>Ave Marias;</hi> I muſt confeſs it were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if thoſe, who uſe the <hi>Roſary,</hi> made all their Devotion to conſiſt in it. But it is well known, that ſuch as ſay it, do to their Power, diſcharge all other Chriſtian Duties; at leaſt do pretend to no Exemption, upon the Score of their <hi>Beads,</hi> or <hi>Roſary,</hi> from Praying to Almighty God, from Adoring and Worſhiping Him, and giving Him their Humble and Hearty Thanks for his Benefits and Bleſſings; from commemorating the Death and Paſſion of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and having recourſe to the Merits thereof, for Mercy and Pardon of their Sins. And now when they have endeavour'd to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge all theſe Eſſential Duties, where lies the harm, if they ſpend ſome part of their ſpare Hours, in ſaying, over and above, ſo many <hi>Ave Marias,</hi> eſpecially ſince they are founded in the Merits of the Death and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Lord and Saviour; in Virtue whereof, all Catholics do hope and truſt,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:103560:125"/>
that the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> and all the Saints, will pray for them? Or how can it be counted a Fault to deſire the Virgin Mary to do that for us, which even the Dr. himſelf, and all the Learned Proteſtants in the world, do acknowledge, She, and all the Saints in Heaven, conſtantly do; tho' we ſhou'd not ask it of them? Now this is plainly the Caſe: All R. Catholics are taught and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted by the Church, to diſcharge firſt their Duty to God, to worſhip and adore him, to put up their Prayers to Him, to thank him for His Benefits, to be ſorry for their ſins, to beg Mercy and Forgiveneſs thro' the Merits of the Paſſion of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and when this is done, if they will take the <hi>Lady's Office,</hi> or the <hi>Litanies</hi> of the <hi>Saints,</hi> or the <hi>V.

In a Word, theſe are Devotions, which certain <hi>Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,</hi> and Regular Societies have taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to diſcharge over and above the neceſſary, and Eſſential Duties of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; and which other Catholics, (to be Partakers of the Prayers of the ſaid Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternities and Societies) do alſo perform. But in ſaying their <hi>Beads,</hi> they do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, as the Dr. wou'd ſuggeſt, ſay ten

                     <p>Here is a General Council of more than 600 Biſhops deſiring the Martyr <hi>Flavianus</hi> to pray for Them. This Council was held in the Year 451, and is one of the <hi>four firſt Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils,</hi> whoſe <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Decrees</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi> Divines do profeſs to receive. So that it cannot be enough ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd, what ſhou'd induce them to reject the <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhou'd never end, if I ſhou'd bring all the Sayings of the <hi>Fathers</hi> on this Subject. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> has a long Diſcourſe upon it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Fauſtus</hi> the <hi>Manichean,</hi> where He gives at large the Reaſons why the Catholic Church gives due Honour to the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires the Aſſiſtance of their Prayers: And St. <hi>Jerom</hi> wrote a Book againſt <hi>Vigilantius</hi> upon this Subject, and calls him <hi>Heretic</hi> for denying the Lawfulneſs of praying to <hi>Saints.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall therefore conclude with this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection; that it is not reaſonable to believe, nay 'tis incredible, that theſe <hi>Holy Fathers,</hi> who took ſo much pains to propagate the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:103560:126"/>
                        <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Christ;</hi> who wrote ſo many Learned and Voluminous Works, which breath ſo much Piety and Chriſtian Devotion; ſpent all their Lives in Holy, and Religious Exerciſes; conſecrated their Time and Labour to the Service of the True and Living God, and were ready to lay down their Lives for the Truth of the Doctrine, which they taught and practis'd, if Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion requir'd; ſhou'd at the ſame Time, write, and practice a Doctrine, which dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates from the Honour, and Mediatorſhip of Jeſus Chriſt; it being their chief Study and Care, to inculcate to the World, that He was the only Lord and Mediator, in whoſe Name and no other, Salvation was to be had. But if the Doctor ſhou'd ſay (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Brethren have) that all theſe <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers</hi> err'd, and conſequently did not underſtand the Doctrine they labour'd ſo earneſtly to Propagate. I anſwer him, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> did a certain, Man to whom, I fear, the Doctor was in ſome Things, but too near akin; <hi>Mallem cum eis errare, quam tecum conſentire:</hi> I had rather err with the <hi>Fathers,</hi> than agree with Him.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have endeavour'd, as plainly and briefly as I cou'd, to ſhew how Reaſonable, how Harmleſs, how Inoffenſive, the Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints is, and how agreeable to the Practice of the <hi>Holy Fathers,</hi> and the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church.</hi> I now proceed.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Before I anſwer this Objection, it won't be amiſs to clear the <hi>Equivocation,</hi> which, in moſt controverſial Diſputes, commonly attends theſe two words, <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I worſhip</hi> is render'd in Latin, <hi>colo,</hi> or <hi>adoro;</hi> in Greek, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>; and in theſe three Languages, 'tis us'd in Scripture, and in common Diſcourſe, not only to ſignifie the ſupream Worſhip and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, we pay to Almighty God, but alſo for all ſort of Reſpect and Reverence done to Kings, Princes, and Perſons of Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Of this we have innumerable Examples in <hi>Scripture;</hi> and not only ſo, but the very Word, which we uſe to ſignifie the ſupream Worſhip due to God alone, is ſometimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to human Affairs: For, as we ſay, <hi>colere Deum,</hi> to worſhip God; <hi>colere Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> to honour our Parents; <hi>colere Vineam, colere Agrum, Hortum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to till the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, to till the Ground,</hi> &amp;c. Yet no Man e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaid, that we rob God of his due Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, by uſing the ſame Expreſſion to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Reſpect we pay ſome Creatures, which we uſe when we expreſs the Honour due only to Him; becauſe the different <hi>Ideas,</hi> or <hi>Notions</hi> we have of God, and theſe Creatures, ſufficiently determin our mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; tho' the want of Words, or rather the Conveniency of delivering our Thoughts in
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:103560:128"/>
fewer Words, oblige us to make uſe of the ſame Term to expreſs theſe different Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>
                     <p>In like Manner, the Word <hi>Invocation</hi> is us'd in Scripture not only to ſignifie our calling upon God, as our Sovereign Lord and Maker; but is alſo us'd, and applied in ſeveral places to ordinary Men. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſays, <hi>Seven Women ſhall take hold of one Man, ſaying, we will eat our own Bread, and wear our own Apparel, only let thy Name be invocated upon us, to take away our Reproach: Tantum invocetur Nomen tuum ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. nos.</hi> Cap. 4.1. So that if we do not attend to the Subject Matter, to which theſe Words are applied, the Scripture will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us ſufficient Grounds for Worſhipping, and invocating not only God, Angels, and Saints, but even common ordinary Men. To worſhip and invocate then, muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily mean, to exhibit a Service, and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to thoſe, whom we worſhip and call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to the <hi>Notion,</hi> or Idea we have of their Excellency and Perfection; and of the Power and Ability we conceive in them to help and aſſiſt us: And then to <hi>Worſhip</hi> God, and <hi>invocate</hi> Him, muſt mean, to pay Him the Supream Honor and Reſpect which is due only to the Great <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> and <hi>Redeemer</hi> of the World; and to beg Mercy and Forgiveneſs of Him, as the Source and Fountain of all Goodneſs; but to Worſhip and Invocate the <hi>Angels</hi> and Saints, muſt mean no more than to ſhew them that reſpect and honor, which is due to the Friends
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:103560:128"/>
and Courtiers of our Sovereign Lord, and to ask their Help and Aſſiſtance in thoſe things, which we conceive they are able to do, that is, to pray for us, and to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend us to their, and our Great Maſter; becauſe theſe only are the Excellencies and Abilities we conceive the Angels and Saints to be endued with, and for which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect them. This ſuppos'd, I anſwer,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks here of Certain <hi>Heretics,</hi> who ſeparated from the <hi>Faithful,</hi> and gave to Angels the ſupream Worſhip and Honour, which is due only to God; as theſe words of his, <hi>not holding the Head,</hi> do plainly denote: For, by theſe Words, He give us to underſtand, that theſe <hi>Heretics</hi> departed from Chriſt, which is the Head; and by theſe other words, <hi>Worſhipping of Angels,</hi> that they offer'd Sacrifice to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, whom they believ'd to have been the <hi>Mediators</hi> of the New <hi>Covenant;</hi> or, as <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret</hi> phraſes it, <hi>that the Law was given by Angels.</hi> But this, I hope, the Proteſtants will not ſay, we believe, or hold.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the Dr's. Interpretation of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> words is altogether forc'd, and by no means warranted by <hi>Theodoret,</hi> or any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Father</hi> of the Church; on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Theodoret</hi> is intirely ours; For He ſays, in that very Place cited by the Doctor, that therefore theſe <hi>Heretics worſhip'd Angels;</hi> becauſe <hi>they believ'd,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Vol. 2. edit. poſt ob. pag. 44.</note> 
                        <hi>the Law was given by Them.</hi> He ſays, indeed, in an other place, which the Doctor quotes, <hi>that we muſt ſend up Thankſgivings to God and the Father, by
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:103560:129"/>
Chriſt, and not by the Angels.</hi> And this, I hope, we are careful to do; for I am ſure we put up all our Prayers to God and the Father, by, or thro' the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt, and not of any Angel or Saint. But ſure it is not reaſonable to believe, that <hi>Theodoret</hi> there meant, that we ought not to deſire the <hi>Angels</hi> or <hi>Saints,</hi> to pray for us; ſince he himſelf, as I obſerv'd before, ſo expreſly ſays, <hi>We not addreſs our ſelves to the Saints as Gods, but we pray unto them as Divine Men, that they wou'd pleaſe to be Legats</hi> (or Interceſſors) <hi>for us.</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. That the Doctor might very well have forborn his Exclamation; for I aſſure him, that excepting the General Confeſſion, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> aforeſaid, we do not invocate, or pray to Angels in the Public Offices of the Church. We have but one <hi>Feaſt</hi> in the Year, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we Commemorate Angels, which is that of St. <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel; and in this (excepting one <hi>Anthem,</hi> in the <hi>Breviary;</hi> and one <hi>Verſile,</hi> in the <hi>Maſs,</hi> which are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Prayers, where 'tis ſaid, in the firſt; <hi>Arch-Angel Michael be mindful of us, and pray for us to the Son of God;</hi> and in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond;
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:103560:129"/>
                        <hi>Holy Michael defend us in Battle, that we periſh not in the dreadful Judgement;</hi> there is no invocating or putting up of Prayers to St. <hi>Michael,</hi> or any other <hi>Angel.</hi> But it ſeems the Doctor was warm upon the Matter, and in ſuch a Caſe, <hi>Rhetorical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations</hi> are more pardonable; pray God they may be pardon'd him in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>His ſecond Objection is to this purpoſe. <q>Mediation and Interceſſion is founded in the Merit and Virtue of the Sacrifice,<note place="margin">Vol. 2. edit. poſt ob. pag. 56, 57.</note> by which Expiation for Sin is made; but this Jeſus Chriſt and no other has done: Therefore He only is <hi>Mediator,</hi> and <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Argument proves too much: For it proves, that neither our Brethren, on Earth; nor the Saints, in Heaven; ought, or can lawfully pray or intercede for us; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not offer the Sacrifice by which Expiation for ſin is made. Yet the Doctor grants, that both our Brethren, on Earth; and the Saints, in Heaven; may, and do pray for us. Well, but granting that <hi>Mediation and Interceſſion is founded in the Virtue and Merit of the Sacrifice, by which Expiation for Sin is made.</hi> Does it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow, that the Saints may not charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beg of God to forgive us our Sins? 'Tis true, Chriſt only has a Right and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to mediate and intercede for us; becauſe he alone paid the Ranſom, and full Value of our Sins, and therefore may, in Juſtice, ask of His <hi>Father</hi> to forgive us. But ſure, this does not hinder, but that the Saints may
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:103560:130"/>
do Us that Charitable Office, as to pray to God to have Mercy upon Us; tho' they cannot in Juſtice demand it. May not a Friend and Favourite of the King beg the Life of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>enitent Criminal? And have not Kings and Princes often granted ſuch Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to their Friends; tho' they were not in Juſtice bound to do ſo? And are not the Saints in Heaven Chriſt's Favourites? Does not He call them his Friends? <hi>Vos Amici mei eſtis.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Job.</hi> 15.14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.28.</note> And, what is more, Does not He tell His <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> that they <hi>ſhall ſit upon Thrones, Judging the twelve Tribes of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael?</hi> And why may not then theſe Judges, and Friends, and Favourites of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> beg of Him to have Mercy upon poor mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Sinners; tho' they cannot in Juſtice require it at his Hands? But the Doctor's Miſtake conſiſts in this, that he does not, (or rather will not) diſtinguiſh between an Interceſſion founded in Juſtice and Equity, and an Interceſſion founded only in Favour and good Will: The firſt, I grant, is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar only to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for the Reaſons offer'd by the Doctor; but the ſecond, which is the Effect of Charity, is common to every one, who is poſſeſt of that Divine Virtue. Well, but, ſays the Doctor, the Mediation or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of Saints is not properly ſpeaking Interceſſion. So ſay I; for I own, that, in the Senſe, in which Chriſt is both our <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi> and <hi>Interceſſor,</hi> the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> in the ſame ſenſe, cannot be call'd <hi>Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors;</hi> but whether he calls them <hi>Interceſſors</hi> in a proper, or an improper Senſe, 'tis all one
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:103560:130"/>
to me. Since he acknowledges, they do pray for us, and intercede with God in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, I am ſatisfied; for I am ſure we deſire no more of them.</p>
                     <p>After this, the Dr. gives us a great many Paſſages out of the <hi>Fathers,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">ibid pag 76, 77, 78. 79. 80, 81 82, 83.</note> to prove the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Saints unlawful; namely out of St. <hi>Ireneus, Origen, Novatian</hi> (for he muſt be a Father too) <hi>Clemens Romanus, St. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius, St. Epiphanius, St. Chryſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>His third Objection is level'd at the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Meaux's Expoſition, of the Doctrine of the Catholic Church;</hi> which ſays,</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>We pray to the Saints in Heaven, in the ſame order of Brotherly Society, with which we intreat our Brethren upon Earth to pray for us. <hi>But that this</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is not a true Repreſentation of their Doctrine, will appear by theſe Conſiderations.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. That they pray (continues He) to the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> in Heaven with the ſame ſolemn Circumſtances of Religious Worſhip, that they pray to God himſelf.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That, in their Prayers and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, they joyn the Angels, and the B. Virgin, and the Saints together with God and Chriſt.</p>

That in the Public Offices of their Church, they do not only pray to the Saints to pray for them, but they direct their Prayers and Thanksgivings immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to them for all thoſe Bleſſings and Benefits, which they ask of God, and thank Him for, of which innumerable Examples (adds He) might be given out of their Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Offices; particularly in the Office of the <hi>B.

                     </q>
                     <p>To which I anſwer,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That there never was a Book more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally commended and approv'd in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Church, than the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux's Expoſition, of the Doctrine of the Catholic Church.</hi> The <hi>Pope</hi> highly commended, and approv'd it; as appears by his <hi>Brief</hi> to this Biſhop, annex'd to the ſaid Book. All the <hi>Cardinals</hi> and Conſiſtory in Rome approv'd it; as the Letters of the Maſter of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Palace,</hi> and the <hi>Conſultor</hi> of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office,</hi> do witneſs; And all the Learned Biſhops and Prelates of the <hi>R.

perus'd by all <hi>R.

                     <p n="2">2. As to his firſt Conſideration; I have already prov'd, that we addreſs no Prayers to Saints, or Angels in the Public Service of the Church, but that all our Prayers are directed to God only; and, as to our Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the Church, or at our private Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whether kneeling, or ſtanding, or bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we declare our intention is to adore God alone, and none elſe.</p>
                     <p>Touching his ſecond Conſideration, <hi>viz. that in their Prayers and Thanksgiving,</hi>

                        <hi>they join the Angels, and the B.

                     </p>
                     <p>To which I anſwer,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That it is very True, we join God, and his Saints together in the ſame breath,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:103560:132"/>
as the Dr. ſaith; but, then our Plea is, that we are taught both by the Old, and New Teſtament ſo to do. For Inſtance. <hi>All the Congregation bleſſed the Lord God of their Fathers; and bowing their Heads, Worſhip'd the Lord and the King.</hi> 1 Chron. 29.20. Here, at the ſame time, and in the ſame act, and in the ſame breath too, 'tis ſaid, that the Iſraelites Worſhip'd God, and the King. Had we but any ſuch thing in our Public Offices, what work wou'd the Dr. make on't! Again, <hi>The people greatly feared the Lord, and Samuel,</hi> 1 Kings 12.18. Here again, God and <hi>Samuel</hi> are join'd together in the ſame Breath. Again, <hi>It ſeem'd good to the Holy Ghoſt and to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, to lay upon you no other Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> Acts 15.28. Again, <hi>I charge thee before God and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Elect Angels,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.21. St. <hi>John</hi> writes to the Seven Churches in <hi>Aſia; Grace be unto you, and Peace from Him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the Seven Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which are before His Throne; and from Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rev. chap. 1. Had we offer'd Peace from the Angels to our Flocks and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them before <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> how loud wou'd He Cry! Yet no leſs than an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath done it. What will the Doctor ſay to all this? Is not God here join'd with Angels, and Saints and Men, in the ſame Breath? And muſt it be a Crime in us to do that, whereof we have ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Precedents in the very words of the Scripture. Truely, to weigh well the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, one wou'd almoſt ſwear, the Doctor
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:103560:132"/>
was not in earneſt; but were I of councel for him, I ſhou'd have advis'd Him, if He had a mind to exhibit ſuch Ridiculous Scenes, not to make the Religion of Jeſus Chriſt, a Theatre of Laughter and Sport; <hi>for God is not mock'd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to his third Conſideration: I anſwer,</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That <hi>Pope Pius</hi> 4. his <hi>worſhiping</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocating</hi> the <hi>Saints,</hi> is to be underſtood in the ſame order of brotherly Society in which we worſhip and reverence our holy Brethren on Earth, upon Account of their Piety and Virtue; and in which we intreat them to pray for us, as the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> ſaith, and as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid long ſince: <hi>Colimus Martyres eo cultu dilectionis &amp; ſocietatis, quo in hac vita coluntur ſancti Deì homines.

So that nothing but an Itch of Contention, and a Spirit of Wrangling cou'd make any Man doubt of our Senſe of theſe Words.

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:103560:133"/>
I hope the Reader will not be ſorry to have it at large, tho' it be ſomething long; and the rather, becauſe it is in anſwer to a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Manichee, who, about twelve Hundred Years ſince, reproach'd St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> with what the Doctor and his Party charge the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholics</hi> at preſent.</p>

                        <q>The Chriſtian People (ſays this <hi>Father</hi>) do celebrate the Memory of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> with a Religious Solemnity, to excite us to their Imitation, to be Partakers of their Merits, and to be aſſiſted by their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.

                     <p>As to his laſt Conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                        <q>That in the public Offices of their Church, they do not only pray to the Saints to pray for them; but they direct their Prayers and Thankſgivings immediately to them, for all thoſe Bleſſings and Benefits, which they ask of God, and thank him for.</q> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>

That this is a notorious Impoſition up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and as great a Mark of Inſincerity; as it is a ſign of a ſinking Cauſe, which needs ſuch foul play to ſupport it. In ſhort, there is nothing more common than the Roman <hi>Miſſal</hi> and <hi>Breviary,</hi> which contain all the public Offices of the Church; and I chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge any Man to find as much as one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Prayer in either of theſe Books, read in
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:103560:134"/>

But that it is not True, I am an Eye Witneſs; for I have, upon this very occaſion read every Word of that Office (I mean the Office of the <hi>B.

This I am certain, that if there be, 'tis more than any Man is warranted by the Church to do. However, ſince none of theſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> make any part of the public Offices, &amp; Service of the Church; nor are ever publickly read in it: The Doctor had no Reaſon to charge ſuch Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers upon the public Offices of the Church; tho' they were found in thoſe private Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the <hi>B.

times, and for all ſorts of Bleſſings, does ſuppoſe them to have the Incommunicable Perfections of the Divine Nature imparted to them, or inherent in them; namely, <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> and <hi>Omniſcience,</hi> and <hi>Immenſe-preſence.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is the great popular Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that takes ſo much with the weaker ſort of People; who meaſure all things by their own capacity, and do not conceive how <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> ſhou'd hear at ſo great a diſtance; becauſe they cannot do ſo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. It will be therefore requiſite to take ſome pains to clear this difficulty, and, if it be poſſible, to diſabuſe theſe ſimple, but well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning People, concerning theſe groſs and carnal thoughts; which, that I may the more plainly do, I ſhall lay down theſe known, and evident Grounds.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That Angels and Saints in Heaven, have naturally a faculty of underſtanding, and communicating their Thoughts; that is, a power connatural to their being, of perceiving the thoughts of others, that are directed to them, and of imparting their own thoughts to others; for theſe are eſſential Properties of <hi>Intelligent Beings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That Angels and Saints in Heaven, do neither ſee, nor hear in the ſenſe we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take theſe Words: For, ſeeing they neither have Eyes, nor Ears, which are the Organs of <hi>Seeing</hi> and <hi>Hearing;</hi> they cannot be ſaid properly to <hi>See</hi> or <hi>Hear,</hi> but only to <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtard;</hi> which is what we mean, when we ſay, the Saints do hear us.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="254" facs="tcp:103560:135"/>3. Hence follows, that Saints and Angels may <hi>Hear,</hi> that is, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand</hi> us, when we direct our thoughts to them, at any diſtance, even at Ten Millions of Miles, as well as if they had been in the ſame Room with us: For, ſince our Words or Thoughts are not convey'd to them by means of any Organs, nor by the motion or impulſe of the Air, as it happens with us; 'tis evident, that diſtance or neerneſs of place can have no part in their way of underſtanding.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That God-Almighty is able to reveal in an Inſtant all our Prayers to the Angels and Saints, be they never ſo far diſtant from us; tho' Angels and Saints are not, properly ſpeaking, diſtant from us; diſtance, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of Speech, being that ſpace, which is between two Bodies</p>
                     <p>Now, whether we conceive that the Angels and Saints, when we direct our thoughts to them, do hear, or rather underſtand us, by that natural faculty, which is eſſential to all Intelligent Beings; or that God reveals our thoughts to them, we do not aſcribe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the incommunicable perfections of the Divine Nature to them, namely <hi>Omnipotence, Omniſcience, Immenſe-Preſence,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Not, if we conceive, that they underſtand our prayers by that natural faculty, which is eſſential to their Being.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. We do not aſcribe <hi>Omnipotence</hi> to them; for <hi>Omnipotence</hi> ſuppoſes a power of doing all things whatſoever poſſible; whereas, we ſuppoſe in the Angels and Saints, at moſt, but a power of obtaining of God
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:103560:135"/>
thoſe benefits and bleſſings we have need of.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Nor <hi>Omniſcience;</hi> for <hi>Omniſcience</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes a knowledge of all things paſt, preſent, and poſſible to be: And we only ſuppoſe, in the Saints, aknowledge of thoſe few pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers we put up to them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Nor <hi>Immenſe-preſence;</hi> for this ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes an immenſity, or a being preſent not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to all the things in the World, but to hundreds of Worlds, if there had been ſo many; whereas the utmoſt of what we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, can amount to no more, than that the Angels and Saints are preſent to thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who beg their Charitable Aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>Nor do we aſcribe any of thoſe divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to them, if we conceive, that God reveals our prayers to them. This the Dr. himſelf does not ſay, but endeavours to elude our Reaſons, by ſaying, that if God reveals our prayers to the Saints, <hi>we ſhou'd pray to Him, before every prayer we make to the Saints, that He wou'd be pleas'd to reveal that prayer to them,— but this ſays he, is ſuch away about, as no Man wou'd take, that cou'd help it.</hi> To which I anſwer, that ſuch Reaſonings are only fit to amuſe the common People, who, as I ſaid above, meaſure all things, even the moſt ſublime, by the notions they have of thoſe things they are here on Earth acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with; whereas the Scripture, and the <hi>Fathers</hi> tell us, that the manner of God's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing His Will to His <hi>Angels</hi> and Saints, is ſo myſterious, and the knowledge and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of theſe bleſſed Spirits ſo vaſt, and, to
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:103560:136"/>
us, ſo incomprehenſible, that nothing on Earth, much leſs ſuch poor ſtuff as the Dr. brings, is able to give us the leaſt glimpſe how theſe things are perform'd.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The beſt way, in my opinion, to remove this difficulty, is to take a ſhort view of the <hi>Character,</hi> and Worſhip, which the Heathens gave to their <hi>Pagan Saints,</hi> as the Dr. is pleas'd to call them; (tho' without any Warrant from the Heathen Writers, who always call them Gods) and ſee, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, upon the Compariſon, the <hi>Chriſtian Saints</hi> be, in any thing, by us treated like Them. And here I ſhall not diſtruſt any Man's knowledge ſo far, as to bring any Authorites from Heathen Writers to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what I ſay; being reſolv'd to inſtance only in ſuch plain things, as our very <hi>School-Boys</hi> are not ignorant of, And,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="257" facs="tcp:103560:136"/>Firſt, As to their <hi>Character,</hi> 'tis no leſs evident, that the <hi>Heathens</hi> gave theſe <hi>Saints</hi> the Attributes of the Supream Being, than that they are repreſented in their Writings under ſuch Circumſtances of Debauchery, Lewdneſs, and Intemperance, as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Debauchees</hi> are hardly capable of. The Doctor cannot deny, but <hi>Jupiter</hi> (to omit ſeveral others) was reckon'd a <hi>Hero</hi> in his Time, according to the <hi>Pagan</hi> Belief. We are told, his Father was <hi>Saturn,</hi> that he was born in <hi>Crete,</hi> and that after his Death, he was, for his great Feats, Deified and got the Supream Dominion in Heaven; as his Brothers <hi>Pluto</hi> and <hi>Neptune</hi> got that of <hi>Hell,</hi> and the <hi>Sea.</hi> This <hi>departed Hero</hi> is deſcrib'd every where with the Majeſty of the true God; He has <hi>Omnipotence</hi> put into His hands: He is repreſented as the Great <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Governour</hi> of the World; and, at the ſame time, is ſaid to be ſullied with all the Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Debauchery imaginable.</p>
                     <p>Now the Chriſtian <hi>Heroes,</hi> or <hi>Saints,</hi> are quite of another Complexion: We give them none of the Attributes of the true God. We believe they fought ſtoutly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Banner of Jeſus Chriſt, reduc'd Kings and Princes, (not by their <hi>Swords,</hi> but by their <hi>Sufferings</hi>) to his Subjection, and laid down their Lives for the Truth of his Doctrine; but we do not put <hi>Omnipotence</hi> into their Hands. We believe they did work Miracles, and wondrous Things; but then we do not ſay, they did theſe Things by their own Power and Virtue; but that they
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:103560:137"/>
were the happy Inſtruments by which God wrought theſe Miracles, in Confirmation of the Word, which he put in their Mouth. We believe the <hi>Saints</hi> are Great Friends, and Favourites of the true God; becauſe <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> has ſo declar'd.

But we ſay, the Saints can do nothing of themſelves; but that all their Sufficiency is from God, who made them what they are.</p>
                     <p>And then, as to their Lives and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; I hope the Doctor wou'd not put me upon proving, that the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and the <hi>B. V. Mary,</hi> and the <hi>Saints</hi> in Heaven are in no manner concern'd in the Lewdneſs, and Intemperance of the <hi>Pagan Saints;</hi> or that we do not aſcribe any ſuch thing to them. So that, as to the <hi>Character,</hi> the <hi>Pagan</hi> and Chriſtian Saints have no more Reſemblance than Black and White.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, as to the Worſhip: The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens worſhip'd their Gods, or <hi>Pagan Saints</hi> (as the Doctor wou'd have it) upon a falſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of their Power and Greatneſs in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; whereas there was no ſuch Gods, or Saints. But we honour and reſpect the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Saints, becauſe we are warranted by the Word of God, that they are ſuch as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent them. The <hi>Heathens</hi> erected <hi>Altars</hi>
                        <pb n="259" facs="tcp:103560:137"/>
to their Gods; but we make <hi>Altars</hi> for none, but one God only. They offer'd <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> to all their Gods and Saints, which is the chief Mark of ſupream Worſhip; but we offer Sacrifice only to the true and living God, as Malice it ſelf cannot deny. They made <hi>Idols,</hi> and believ'd that their Gods came, and dwelt in them; and that many of them ſpake, and eat, and drank; and for that Reaſon they worſhip'd them, and therefore are juſtly call'd <hi>Idolaters;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they worſhip'd things that were not; but we only put up in our Churches, the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages</hi> and <hi>Pictures</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Living God, and of ſuch as, we are ſure, are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Saints;</hi> but do not believe that there is any Virtue or Divinity in them for which they ought to be worſhip'd: On the contrary, we are expreſly forbid to give theſe <hi>Pictures</hi> or <hi>Images,</hi> any manner of Worſhip for their own Sake; but that the reſpect, which we ſhew them, is to be referr'd to the Originals, namely to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Saints.</hi> And ſure theſe things, which repreſent Chriſt and his Saints to our Eyes, and put us in mind of the Death and Paſſion of the One, and of the Patience and Sufferings of the Others, are worthy of ſome Reſpect; and may very well be honour'd upon Account of what they repreſent, without any Danger of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, as the Pictures of Kings, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and other Men by whom we receive Benefits, are, in their own degree, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly reſpected, and had in Eſteem, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuch Suſpition. In one Word the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:103560:138"/>
                        <hi>Heathens</hi> call'd all their <hi>Heroes,</hi> or Saints, Gods; ſacrific'd to them, as ſuch; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip'd them, as ſuch; call'd upon them, as ſuch; but we do not call the Chriſtian Saints, Gods; we do by no means ſacrifice to them, nor worſhip them, as Gods; nor call upon them, as Gods. So that, upon the whole matter, the Doctor might as well reſemble <hi>Sea</hi> to dry Land, or <hi>Light</hi> to Darkneſs, or the obſcureſt Night to the brighteſt Day; as compare the Worſhip we give the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Saints</hi> to that, which the <hi>Heathens</hi> paid to their <hi>Heroes,</hi> or <hi>Saints,</hi> as the Doctor is pleas'd to call them.</p>

                  <p>WHat the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> declares concerning <hi>Images</hi> is this: <hi>That the Images of Chriſt, of the Virgin Mother of God, and of other Saints are to be had, and kept, eſpecially in Churches; and that due Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Reſpect is to be given them; not that we believe any virtue, or Divinity to be in them, for which they ought to be worſhip'd; or that we ſhou'd ask any thing of them, or put any truſt or confidence in them; as was formerly done by the Gentils, who put their truſt in Idols; but becauſe the Honor done to them, is refer'd to the Originals, which they
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:103560:138"/>
repreſent. So that by thoſe Images, which we kiſs, and before which we uncover our Heads and bow down, we adore Chriſt, and reverence the Saints, whoſe likeneſs they bear.</hi> Seſ. 25. Dec. de invocat. Sanct.</p>
                  <p>Here, you ſee, this <hi>Council</hi> only requires, that we give <hi>du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> honor and reſpect to <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;</hi> which ſignifies no more, than that we ought to give them the honor which is due to them. But this is not all; for the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> adds, that when we uncover our Heads, or bow towards <hi>Images,</hi> we adore Chriſt and reverence the <hi>Saints,</hi> whoſe likeneſs theſe <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> bear. So that it is not ſo much the <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> we honor, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> and His Saints. And ſince 'tis confeſs'd, that the <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> of all ſacred things, are worthy of ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, in propotion to what they repreſent; how mnch more ought the <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Source and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all Holineſs and Sanctification; and of the Saints, (to whoſe Charity and goodneſs we owe under God our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi>) to be had in Honor and Eſteem. We honor and reſpect the <hi>Bible</hi> more than ordinary Books, tho' it is but Paper and Ink like other Books; becauſe the <hi>Characters</hi> therein contain'd are ſacred Signs, which repreſent to us the Word and Will of God: And even Nature teaches us to honor and reſpect the <hi>Pictures</hi> and <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> and of our Friends, for the Excellency of theſe Perſons, and the Benefits we receive by them. And why may not we likewiſe honor and reſpect thoſe Signs or <hi>Images,</hi> which repreſent to us that,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:103560:139"/>
which is moſt Excellent, and moſt Auguſt in the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> namely <hi>Chriſt</hi> and His <hi>Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Chief End of <hi>Images,</hi> and Pictures, is to adorn our <hi>Churches,</hi> to put us in mind of the Paſſion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of the Piety and Virtue of the Saints; and to be Books to the Ignorant. And what Ornament ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the <hi>Church</hi> of God, as the Picture of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who planted it with His Blood? What, in the next Place, as the Pictures of <hi>Saints,</hi> who water'd it with their's; and are now, in their own Degree, the great Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Heavens? What can be more powerful to excite us to a greatful Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Paſſion of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> then to behold a <hi>Crucifix,</hi> which repreſents Him to us, with Arms ſtretch'd out, as it were, to embrace us, and Hands, and Feet, and Side pierc'd for our Sins? What pious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian can then abſtain from expreſſing the Senſe of his Heart, by ſome exteriour Act of Honor and Reſpect to ſuch a Repreſentation, if not for its own, at leaſt, for the ſake of that, which it repreſents? And, as to the Ignorant, it cannot be denied, but that when they are taught, that ſuch a <hi>Picture</hi> repreſents <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who in that poſture Sacrific'd Himſelf for their Sins; that ſuch other <hi>Pictures</hi> repreſent the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> who preach'd, and deliver'd that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> to them, by which they are to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally happy; it cannot be denied, I ſay, but that ſuch leſſons are eaſily retain'd, and create in their Minds a greatful acknowlede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:103560:139"/>
of the Mercies of their Redeemer, and a deſire to imitate the Virtue and Piety of the <hi>Saints.</hi> And then the Reſpect which they ſhew to theſe <hi>Pictures,</hi> is but the Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of their Senſe of the Benefits they receive by the Paſſion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and by the Piety and Charity of the <hi>Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe were the chief motives, that induc'd the Church in all Ages, to have, and to keep the <hi>Pictures</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and His <hi>Saints.</hi> I ſay in all Ages. <hi>Euſebius</hi> the Great and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorian,</hi>

This is the Declaration, The Ingenious Author of <hi>The Expoſition of the Doctrine of the Church of

England,</hi> in anſwer to the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Meaux,</hi> makes in the Name of that Church.<note place="margin">page 18.</note> It may not be amiſs to ſubjoin his very Words: <hi>We will honor,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Relicks of the Saints, as the primitive Church did: We will reſpect the Images of our Saviour, and the B. Virgin: And as ſome of us now bow towards the Altar, and all of us are enjoy'd to do ſo, at the Name of Jeſus; ſo will we not fail to teſtifie all due Reſpect to this Repreſentation.</hi> Now we do-likewiſe declare, and have upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons done, that we neither mean, nor intend to give any more to the <hi>Images</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the <hi>V.

But if neither the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs <hi>Decree</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> which commands us to give them no more; nor the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Meaux's</hi> Expoſition of our Doctrine, in which this is ſo manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd; nor our own often repeated Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations to that Effect, will prevail upon them to believe us; all we can ſay is, that we are ſorry for their Incredulity, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help it. As to thoſe Abuſes, which this Ingenious Man ſays have crept in upon Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Images:</hi> If there be any ſuch, we proteſt and declare, that we abhor and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt them, no leſs than he, or any of his Perſwaſion; or (to uſe the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent's</hi> Phraſe) we earneſtly deſire, they ſhou'd be intirely aboliſh'd. But ſure he was too rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to think, that the abuſe of a thing was a good Argument againſt the uſe of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="265" facs="tcp:103560:140"/>Nor will his Example of <hi>Hezekiahis</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the <hi>Brazen Serpent</hi> help the matter: For he may pleaſe to conſider, that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> liv'd in a Country, where they were ſurrounded, and as I may ſay, hedg'd in, on every ſide, with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and the Worſhip of falſe Gods; and not only ſo, but they themſelves were very much given to that Worſhip, as appears by the <hi>Groves,</hi> and <hi>high Places,</hi> and <hi>Idols</hi> ſet up among them, by their wicked <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Rulers;</hi> and which this pious King pull'd down and deſtroy'd; and therefore is deſervedly commended in <hi>Scripture</hi> for breaking in pieces the Brazen Serpent, to which the People, no doubt, ſacrific'd. But, bleſſed be God, we have no ſuch thing to fear: We have no <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters</hi> among us, nor near us; we have no <hi>Groves</hi> nor <hi>high Places,</hi> nor <hi>Idols</hi> in the land. We do not burn Incenſe to any falſe Gods, nor worſhip them. We make only the <hi>Images,</hi> and <hi>Pictures</hi> of the true God, and his <hi>Saints;</hi> and it cannot be denied, but theſe ſame Pictures and <hi>Images,</hi> have been kept in our Churches; and have had the ſame reſpect given them, which we now give, at leaſt theſe nine hundred years; and, in the Opinion of many learned <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> for four hundred Years before. Yet all this while no Heathen <hi>Idolatry</hi> was ever introduc'd into the Church, upon Account of our <hi>Images:</hi> No Defection from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity to <hi>Pagan</hi> Worſhip was heard among us. So that the Example of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> is not to the purpoſe, the Parallel is not juſt,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:103560:141"/>
we are nothing concern'd in it. Beſides, the <hi>Brazen Serpent</hi> was a Monument of no ſuch great Moment to be long preſerv'd: 'Twas only kept, to put the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in mind of the Miraculous Cure of thoſe, who were bitten by the Serpents in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; and when they left that Land, and were no more vex'd by theſe Serpents, it was of no great uſe. But the Remembrance of the Death and Paſſion of our Lord, by whom the Sins of the World was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; and of his Holy Apoſtles and Saints, by whom his Doctrine was propagated and tranſmitted to us, is of that high Importance and Concern to all the World, that theſe Monuments, which put us in mind of them, ought to be for ever moſt carefully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd.</p>

ſhou'd be ignorant of; ſeeing the Church, in that <hi>Council,</hi> has expreſly declar'd, that <hi>by the Images, which we kiſs, and before which we uncover our Heads and bow down, we adore Christ, and reverence the Saints.</hi> Here is a Crucifix propos'd to us, a Repreſentation of <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> upon Mount <hi>Calvary;</hi> we kiſs it, and bow to it; and when we ſay, <hi>Come let us adore;</hi> we muſt ſurely mean, <hi>come let us adore Chriſt;</hi> elſe we ſhou'd contradict the expreſs words of the <hi>Council.</hi> I own indeed, that we mean likewiſe by Kiſſing the <hi>Crucifix,</hi> and bowing to it that day, to give it due <hi>Honour</hi> and Reſpect; and that we make uſe of the words, <hi>Crucem A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doramus,</hi> ſeveral Times on <hi>Good-Fryday,</hi> to expreſs the Reſpect we give it.

Creatures ought to be ador'd in the ſtrict Propriety of Adoration or Supream Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; but the Senſe is, that they ought to be worſhip'd with the Honor and Reſpect, that is due to Them.

hope, ſhall never be contradicted by me. But if He underſtands by Worſhip; to give <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> that Honor and Reſpect, which is due to Things, that repreſent <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and His Saints; he is contradicted by <hi>Scripture,</hi> by all Antiquity, and even by his own Church, as well as by us. Now that we give Images no other Worſhip than the latter; or that the Decrees of our Church enjoin no more, I think I have already ſufficiently prov'd.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Second; I anſwer, that we never left out any of God's <hi>Commandments,</hi> either in <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> or <hi>Manual;</hi> and that that, which he ſays is left out (which yet is not the Second Commandment, but part of the Firſt) is to be found in hundreds of Manuals and Catechiſms in <hi>England</hi> it ſelf. And at this Time, I have, upon my Table, a <hi>Manual</hi> and <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> wherein all, He ſays we left out, are contain'd: The firſt bears this Title; <hi>a Manual of Prayers, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Devotions;</hi> the later, <hi>An Abridgment of Chriſtian Doctrine with Proofs out of Scripture.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The firſt Edition printed, Anno.</hi> 1649. Now a Man that can diſpenſe with his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and honor ſo far, as to publiſh, from Preſs and Pulpit, untruths ſo eaſily diſcover'd; what Paradox may not he undertake to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? 'Tis true, there are ſome <hi>Manuals</hi> and <hi>Catechiſms,</hi> in which the Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are comprehended, as it were, in ſo many <hi>Verſes;</hi> that Children, and People of weak Capacity may learn them with more caſe: But in no <hi>Manual</hi> or <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> that pretends to give the Commandments, was
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:103560:143"/>
ever the <hi>Second Commandment</hi> left out. That which he calls the <hi>Second Commandment,</hi> viz. <hi>Thou ſhalt not Make to thy Self any graven Image,</hi> &amp;c. is undoubtedly part of the <hi>First;</hi> &amp; only added to inculcate to a Groſs Ignorant People, what they were to avoid, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the One God, which the <hi>Firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment</hi> obliges them to have: For 'tis evident, that in theſe Words, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods but me,</hi> is neceſſarily imply'd, that they ſhou'd not make to themſelves any <hi>Graven Images,</hi> or <hi>Idols</hi> to Worſhip them; which to do, were to have other Gods: And therefore theſe two Negatives make but one Commandment. Unleſs the Dr. will have it, that it is a diſtinct Commandment from the firſt; becauſe it begins a Verſe, or contains ſome Words, which are not expreſs'd in the firſt. But he may pleaſe to conſider, that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was extant, at leaſt a Thouſand Years, before it was digeſted into Verſes, or that any Points were added to it; during which Time, there was nothing to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh one <hi>Commandment</hi> from an other, but the very Reaſon and Nature of the things commanded; and then, ſince this, which the Dr. wou'd have to be the <hi>Second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> is altogether of the ſame Nature with the <hi>Firſt,</hi> and prohibits nothing but what the <hi>Firſt</hi> prohibits, namely, the having or worſhiping more than one God; we have all the Reaſon in the World to conclude, that it is but <hi>One,</hi> and the ſame <hi>Commandment</hi> with the <hi>Firſt.</hi> And thus all our Anceſtors, and all the Ancient's Comments upon this Chapter
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:103560:144"/>
of <hi>Moſes,</hi> at leaſt, as many as I have ſeen, underſtood it; and even <hi>Martin Luther</hi> in thoſe Books, which he wrote againſt the Church of Rome, makes but one Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Doctor's <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Second.</hi> But if He will have it, that it is a diſtinct <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> becauſe it has a diſtinct prohibition; then it will follow, that we muſt have as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Commandments</hi> as we have diſtinct Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions in that Chapter, beſides the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Precepts; and then we ſhall have 13 or 14 <hi>Commandments</hi> at leaſt. <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy Self any graven Image,</hi> muſt be the <hi>Second; thou ſhalt not how down to them,</hi> the <hi>Third; thou ſhalt not take the Name of thy Lord thy God in vain, the Fourth; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to keep holy the Sabbath Day,</hi> the <hi>Fifth; thou ſhalt do no manner of Work,</hi> the <hi>Sixth;</hi> and ſo on. But as the Dr. wou'd not, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, allow of this diſtribution, ſo He may pleaſe to give us leave to ſtick to the Old Ten Commandments, in the ſame order &amp; manner, we receiv'd them from our Anceſtors of Bleſſed Memory.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>Of Purgatory.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WHat we hold, as of Faith concerning this Point, is thus declar'd by the Council of Trent: <hi>That there is a Purgatory,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:103560:144"/>
and that the Souls there detain'd, are help'd by the Prayers of the Faithful, but eſpecially by the acceptable Sacrifice of the Maſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the Council do's not determine what ſort of Place <hi>Purgatory</hi> is, or what manner of Pain Souls endure in it; nor whether they are purg'd by material Fire, or by other Torments or Anguiſhes of Mind; but is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to declare with the Ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> that there is a Place, wherein Souls departed are detain'd, without entering upon curious &amp; need leſs Queſtions concerning the Manner, or Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Pains they there ſuffer. In hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling therefore this Argument, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to tred in the Steps of the Ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> and follow the Pattern of this <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> waving all ſuperfluous and needleſs Queſtions relating to this Subject; which, that I may the more plainly and diſtinctly do, I ſhall proceed in this Method.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>I will endeavour to ſhew, that the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Purgatory is founded in Scripture, as interpreted by the Ancient Fathers of the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>But more eſpecially, that it is founded in the Practice obſerv'd in the primitive Church, of Praying for the Dead.</hi> This I take to be an unanſwerable Argument; for if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> did pray for the Dead, that their Sins might be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given them; then it will neceſſarily follow, that they believ'd thoſe Souls, they thus pray'd for, to be in a place, where they might be help'd, and benefited by their Prayers. This is evident; for, if the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:103560:145"/>
Church</hi> were of Opinion, that all Souls departed, did go ſtrait to <hi>Heaven,</hi> or to <hi>Hell;</hi> it were vain and ſuperfluous to pray for them. They knew, there was no getting of Souls out of <hi>Hell;</hi> for, <hi>out of Hell there is no Redemption:</hi> And therefore it were in vain to attempt it. And it were ſuperfluous to pray for the Souls in Heaven, for the Remiſion of their Sins: For, why ſhou'd they pray for that, which they knew they had no need of. So that, if they did pray for the Remiſſion of Sins of Souls de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, the Conſequence is inevitable, that they did believe, there was a <hi>Third Place,</hi> were ſome Souls were detain'd, and might be aſſiſted by their Prayers, which is what we call <hi>Purgatory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>I ſhall anſwer what Doctor Tillotſon brings againſt this Point.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>I ſhall endeavour to ſhew that the Doctrine of Purgatory is founded in Scripture, as inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by the Ancient Fathers of the Church.</hi> To prove this Head; I will produce ſome <hi>Texts</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> with the Readings of the <hi>Fathers</hi> upon Them. 1. <hi>Agree with thine Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary quickly, whilst thou art in the way with him: Leſt at any time, the Adverſary deliver thee to the Judge, and the Judge deliver thee to the Officer, and thou be coſt into Priſon.

                  <p>I might inſiſt upon ſeveral other Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and bring more Texts of <hi>Scripture</hi> with the Senſe of the <hi>Fathers</hi> upon them, with Reſpect to this Subject; but, I think what is here offer'd is ſufficient to ſhew, that our Doctrine concerning <hi>Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> is founded in <hi>Scripture;</hi> and that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Fathers</hi> did believe it to be ſo. I ſhall now proceed to ſhew,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Doctrine of <hi>Purgatory</hi> is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Practice, obſerv'd in the Primitive Church, of praying for the Dead, for the Remiſſion of Sins. This, as I ſaid before, if made out, will plainly eſtabliſh our <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net:</hi> For, if the Primitive Church did pray for the Dead, for the Remiſſion of their Sins; it follows neceſſarily, that they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd them capable of being aſſiſted by their Prayers; and conſequently neither in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, nor in Hell, but in a third Place, which is what we believe, and call <hi>Purgatory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, that the Primitive Church, and all ſucceeding Generations us'd to pray for the Dead, for the Remiſſion of their Sins; no one Point in the Chriſtian Religion is more Univerſally atteſted. St. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> tells us, that <hi>Aerius</hi> was reputed an Heretic for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Lawfulneſs of it; and beſides him,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:103560:147"/>
I do not find ſince Chriſtianity began, till the Begining of the laſt Age, any one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Perſon, that ever denied or queſtion'd it. Never was there found any <hi>Liturgy</hi> without it; nothing ſo frequent in the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Writers,</hi> as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of it: In a Word, there is not one Doctrine or Practice of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Religion deliver'd with ſo full, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable a Tradition; no not the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi> of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> no nor the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> nor the Neceſſity of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> nor even the Truth of the Scriptures.

And this St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells us was the Deſign and End of all the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers put up for the Dead, whether <hi>Apoſtles</hi> or <hi>Martyrs,</hi> or other Chriſtian Souls.

                     <hi>who receiv'd Baptiſm, were Thankſgivings for ſuch as were very Good, Propitiations for ſuch as were not very Bad; but for ſuch as were very wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, tho' they gave no Relief to the Dead, yet were they ſome Conſolation to the Living.</hi> And is not this the very Doctrine we hold this Day? Do not we offer the <hi>Sacrifice of Chriſt's Body,</hi> as this <hi>Father</hi> calls it, on the <hi>Feaſts</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Martyrs,</hi> &amp;c. in Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to God for the bleſſed Eſtate of the Saints in Heaven? And do not we pray, and give Alms and offer the ſame Sacrifice for the Propitiation of thoſe, whom we chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably believe to have died in the Peace, and Communion of the Church? Does our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God for the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> as aforeſaid, hinder us to believe, that there is a Place wherein other Souls are detain'd till they have ſatisfied the Divine Juſtice? No ſure: And why muſt the like Prayers hinder the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> to believe the ſame? Nay rather does it not neceſſarily follow, that the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> as well as We, did believe there was ſuch a place; becauſe they put up Prayers to God
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:103560:149"/>
for Pardon and Forgiveneſs of Sins, for ſuch as they reaſonably believ'd to have died in the <hi>Communion of the Body of Chriſt</hi> (as the Fathers ſpeak) <hi>but not ſo perfect, as that they ſhou'd not need their Prayers;</hi> ſince it were both vain and ſuperfluous to have pray'd for them upon this Score, had they believ'd, they were immediately receiv'd into Heaven, or thruſt into Hell. This I am confident no Man of Senſe can reaſonably deny: So that it is a moſt ſhameful Evaſion, to conclude, that the Primitive Church did not believe <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory;</hi> becauſe they pray'd for the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Martyrs,</hi> &amp;c. elſe why do they not conclude, that we do not believe it; becauſe we do the ſame?</p>
                  <p>To ſum up all theſe Evidences then, I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus: The Primitive Church pray'd to God for ſome Souls departed, that they might be deliver'd out of Priſon; that their Faults, and Sins might be forgiven them; that they might be eas'd of their Pain; that they might be ſav'd from the Puniſhment of Fire; that they might be receiv'd into Heaven; but ſuch Prayers are inconſiſtent with a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that the Souls departed are immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken into Heaven, or condemn'd to Hell. Therefore the Primitive Church believ'd there was a <hi>Third Place,</hi> wherein ſome ſouls departed were detain'd, and were capable of being aſſiſted and better'd by their Prayers.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Propoſition is taken from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Words of the Fathers, and acknowledged by our Adverſaries to be true. The ſecond, a very ſmall portion of Natural Reaſon, with
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:103560:149"/>
never ſo little inſight in <hi>Scripture,</hi> and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion (which aſſure us that Prayers of that nature, for thoſe that are in Heaven or Hell, are needleſs and vain) will eaſily diſcover to be likewiſe True. And I think, the conſequence is rightly infer'd; I now proceed to the Objections.</p>

                  <p>I anſwer, that I have produc'd two Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from Scripture, and cou'd produce as many more; which the moſt Eminent <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> have interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and therefore I think, I may ſafely tell the Dr. that, with ſubmiſſion, He was miſtaken.

But it ſeems he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got in his ſecond Sermon upon this Text, that in his Firſt, he had told us, that the Dead, which die in the Lord, in Scripture Phraſe, are thoſe who die, or are put to death for the Lord's Cauſe, that is, as he expreſly ſays, ſuffer <hi>Martyrdom</hi> for the Lord; I ſay, he muſt have forgot this, elſe he wou'd not have objected that Text againſt Purgatory; ſince he cou'd not be ignorant, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that all the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> who ſuffer for the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and even other Eminent
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:103560:150"/>
Saints, who do not ſuffer <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> but live the life of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> do reſt from their Labours, and paſs not thro' the Fire of Purgatory. Wherefore in my opinion, he ſhou'd have given us an other Interpretation of this Text, or have let Purgatory alone, but 'tis no new thing to find the Doctor pulldown in one place what he had built in an other; and therefore I am not ſurpriz'd to ſee Purgatory brought in by Head and Shoulders, and ſpoken againſt in <hi>Seaſon,</hi> and out of <hi>Seaſon.</hi> 'Tis Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that reproaches the <hi>Sacrileges,</hi> and <hi>Depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations</hi> of the Doctor's Anceſtors of worthy Memory, and Bears hard upon their Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and upon that account, it muſt be Cry'd down, leſt the horrid guilt of the <hi>Sacrileges</hi> of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> ſhou'd fly in the Face of their Children, and give them that Purgatory in this Life, which, He wou'd perſwade them, they ſhall not meet with, in the next.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> After my hearty thanks to the Dr. for his Charitable Opinion of us, I muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, from what is above ſaid, that, it ſeems, this Market of <hi>Indulgences</hi> is of a very long
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:103560:151"/>
ſtanding; and that the Ancient Fathers of the Church, took great care it ſhou'd not ſink. But to be ſerious: 'Tis well known, and even acknowledged by the Learned of his Church, that in the Time of <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> now a Thouſand Years ſince, the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and all the Practices con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent upon it, were believ'd and us'd, as they are now. And did that great <hi>Saint</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt as few as he cou'd from <hi>Purgatory,</hi> only to raiſe the Market of <hi>Indulgences?</hi> Did all the Biſhops of the <hi>Weſtern Church,</hi> nay and of all the World, concur with him in this, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fill his Coffers? Alas! The good Holy Man had but few Coffers, and as little Money to fill them with: Converſion of Souls, not Money was his bus'neſs. Did St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the raiſing of the Market of <hi>Indulgences,</hi> or the putting of the People into a fear of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Purgatory, when he earneſtly deſires, the Readers of his Confeſſions to pray for his Mother <hi>Monica's</hi> Soul for the remiſſion of her Sins? And had St. <hi>Jerom</hi> any thoughts of filling the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Coffers, when he wrote, that <hi>much benefit wou'd accrue to the Souls depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by the commemoration made of them in the venerable and dreadful Myſteries?</hi> For ſhame Doctor! Away with ſuch unchriſtian Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, and do not put us upon expoſing your Credit and Character any farther. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Legacies left for the <hi>bireing of Prieſts</hi> (as he odly phraſes it) <hi>to ſay Maſs, for the delivery of Souls out of the place of Torments,</hi> will mend the matter. Indeed, if the <hi>Prieſts</hi> were allow'd to determin matters of <hi>Faith,</hi>
                     <pb n="287" facs="tcp:103560:151"/>
the thing (comming from the Doctor) wou'd not appear altogether ſo unreaſonable; for, conſidering how very remarkable his Charity is to <hi>Prieſts,</hi> I do not queſtion, He wou'd judge they wou'd deal well for themſelves, had they but the handling of theſe matters. But, it is no leſs evident, that no ſimple Prieſt has ever yet had any Vote in declaring mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Faith,</hi> than that no other is hired (as He calls it) or will receive any Money for ſaying <hi>Maſſes</hi> for the <hi>Living,</hi> or the <hi>Dead;</hi> but the poorer, or more indigent ſort of <hi>Prieſts,</hi> who have not a ſufficient Patrimony, or Maintenance to ſubſiſt without it. And the matter being undeniably ſo; where is the Conſcience in ſaying, that the <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Prelates</hi> of the Church, ſhou'd poſſeſs the People with the fear of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> only to oblige them to hire ſome indigent <hi>Prieſts</hi> to ſay <hi>Maſs</hi> for their Souls? But the Scandal is ſo groſs and palpable, that the beſt anſwer I can make it is to contemn it.</p>
                  <p>The Doctor has ſome two, or three Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections more upon this Subject; but they are either ſolv'd in the Proofs brought for this Point, or coincident with thoſe Objections already ſpoken to; or elſe have no particular Difficulty: And ſo I take leave of him for this Time.</p>

                  <p>THE Power of <hi>Indulgences</hi> is founded in the Power of the <hi>Keys</hi> wherewith <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> was pleas'd to intruſt the Paſtors and Governours of the Church; by which Emblem of <hi>Keys,</hi> is denoted the Power of opening and ſhutting the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; of letting in, and keeping out, as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhall be found worthy, of the one, or the other. This Power is promis'd to <hi>Saint Peter,</hi> in a ſpecial Manner, and in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to all his lawful Succeſſors, in theſe Words: <hi>I ſay unto thee, that thou art Peter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> (i. e. a Rock) <hi>and upon this Rock I will build my Church; and the Gates of Hell ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt it. And I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven; and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou ſhalt bind on Earth, ſhall be bound in Heaven; and whatſoever thou ſhalt looſe on Earth ſhall be looſed in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 16.18.19. Again, the Promiſe of binding and looſing is made, in another Place, to all the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in the ſame Words: <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, whatſoever ye bind on Earth, ſhall be bound in Heaven: And whatſoever ye looſe on Earth, ſhall be looſed in Heaven,</hi> Matt. 18.18. And Chriſt, a little before his Aſcenſion, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally confer'd this power upon them, and told
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:103560:152"/>
them wherein it conſiſts. <hi>Receive ye the Holy-Ghoſt; whoſoever Sins ye remit, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto them, and whoſoever Sins ye retain, they are retain'd.</hi> Joa. 20.22, 23. So that the Power of the <hi>Keys</hi> conſiſts in remitting of Sins, and retaining them; that is, in looſing Men from thoſe Bands of Iniquity, wherewith they tye themſelves, and in bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up, or keeping them bound, till they have ſatisfied for their Sins, according to the Rules preſcrib'd for that purpoſe. In a Word, in opening the Gates of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, and letting ſome in; and in ſhutting the ſame, and excluding others, as they ſhall be found to have deſerv'd it.</p>
                  <p>But, whereas our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> did not intend, that the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and their Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors ſhou'd bind Sinners ſo, as finally to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them from the Kingdom of Heaven; but only to keep them under Diſcipline for a Time, till they had fulfill'd the Terms of the Covenant upon which he offers them Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; which conſiſts in Obedience to His Laws, in Repentance and Satisfaction for their Sins, and Amendment of Life for the Time to come; ſo the Church in all Ages never retain'd the Sins of Men for any other End, than to keep them in a wholeſome and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Diſcipline; till, by penitential and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious Works, they had given Marks of their Sorrow and Repentance, in Proportion to the Greatneſs of their Sins. And as the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> and their <hi>Succeſſors</hi> are commiſſion'd by Chriſt to retain Sins, ſo likewiſe are they to looſe them: And therefore may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:103560:153"/>
abate, or alter theſe penitential and laborious Works, as their Prudence and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhall judge it moſt expedient.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Indulgence</hi> is nothing elſe but a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation, or Remiſſion of ſome part of (or all) theſe penitential Works to which a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is lyable by the <hi>Canons</hi> of the Church; which Remiſſion is granted by the Paſtors, but eſpecially by the <hi>Chief Paſtor</hi> of the Church, upon ſome weighty Conſiderations, for the greater Benefit, and Advantage of the Faithful in general: Which that we may the better underſtand, it will be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, to lay open ſome part of the Diſcipline of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> with Reſpect to this Matter.</p>
                  <p>We have 50 Canons, that go under the Name of the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> which, if not of them, are undoubtedly of ſome <hi>Apoſtolical Biſhops</hi> of the firſt or ſecond Age; their Uſe and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority being very great ſince that Time. We have likewiſe the Canons of ſeveral <hi>Provincial Councils</hi> of the third and fourth Age, which have been in great Eſteem and Veneration among the Ancients; and for the pure and wholeſome Diſcipline contain'd in them, have been inſerted in the <hi>Codex Canonum,</hi> or Book of Canons of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church,</hi> as the Ancient Writers term it. Theſe <hi>Canons,</hi> among other Matters of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, preſcribe the different Penances, which were to be impos'd upon Sinners in proportion to the greatneſs of their Sins; whence came the Name of <hi>Penitential Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> ſo famous in Antiquity. Some Canons
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:103560:153"/>
preſcribe ſeven Years Penance to certain Sins; others, eight Years to other ſins; ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe ten Years, ſome fifteen, ſome to the Hour of Death. Some Penitents, by order of theſe Canons, faſted three Days every Week, during the Time of their Penance; uſing no other Suſtenance, during that Time, but Bread and Water; others ſtood co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with Sackcloath at the Church Doors <hi>ſub dio,</hi> in the open Air, on <hi>Sundays</hi> and <hi>Feſtivals,</hi> while their Penance laſted; others ſtood within Doors cloathed in the ſame Raiment, weeping and lamenting their ſins; ſome lay proſtrate upon the Floor begging and praying their Brethren to intercede for them; others were admitted to hear divine Service, in the Weeds of Penitents after they had gone thro' the foremention'd <hi>Stations;</hi> whence the Names of <hi>Hyemantes, Flentes, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrati, Audientes,</hi> ſo often mention'd in the Canons.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe Rigorous Penances (very Rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous I am ſure they wou'd appear in our Days) or <hi>Exomologeſes,</hi> as ſome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers call them, were ſometimes abated and remitted; partly upon Account of the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of the Penitents, who, before they had gone thro' all their Stations, gave ſuch Marks of ſincere Repentance, that, to encourage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to follow their Examples, they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Communion and Fellowſhip of the Faithful; tho' they had not compleated, the Time preſcrib'd by the Canons: Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but more eſpecially, at the Interceſſion of the <hi>Martyrs:</hi> For when any <hi>Martyrs</hi> were
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:103560:154"/>
to be executed, and had begg'd of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to indulge thoſe Penitents, whom they recommended to them; the Biſhops, who cou'd not in Reaſon, refuſe any thing in their Power, to Men, who were ready to lay down their Lives, and ſhed their Blood for the <hi>Chriſtian Faith;</hi> did commonly grant their Requeſts. And this the Fathers call'd (as in very deed it is) <hi>Indulgence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It were endleſs to inſtance in all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, which might be brought from the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the ſecond and third Age upon this Subject. St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> is moſt remarkable in this Bus'neſs. We have ſeveral of his Epiſtles, wherein he tells us, that having ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often granted <hi>Indulgences</hi> to Penitents, at the requeſt of Martyrs; he was forc'd at laſt (being too much importun'd for Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who did not deſerve that Favor) to write to the <hi>Martyrs</hi> themſelves, to beg of them, that they wou'd not recommend, but ſuch as were worthy of that Grace; at leaſt, that they ſhou'd not take it ill, if he ſhou'd not grant their Requeſt; leſt the Diſcipline of the Church ſhou'd be enervated upon that Score. The ſame <hi>Father</hi> complains in his Letters to the <hi>Clergy</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to others, that ſome of his own <hi>Prieſts,</hi> in his Abſence, had preſum'd to give <hi>Indulgences,</hi> which the Biſhops only cou'd do. In ſhort, there is nothing more frequently mention'd both by <hi>Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiastical Writers;</hi> or more univerſally practic'd for the four firſt Ages, than theſe <hi>Indulgences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="293" facs="tcp:103560:154"/>Now the <hi>Roman Catholic Church</hi> neither means by <hi>Indulgences.</hi> nor pretends to any more than the ſame Power, which the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive <hi>Fathers</hi> both had and practic'd; that is, of diſpenſing with, or remitting the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances preſcrib'd by the Canons; nor did ſhe ever pretend to diſpenſe with any Man from Repentance for Sins, or Obedience to the Law of God. On the contrary, the <hi>R. C. Church</hi> teaches, and has always taught, that all the <hi>Indulgences</hi> in the World do ſignifie nothing, without a hearty Contrition and ſincere Sorrow for Sin, which is the Spirit and Eſſence of Chriſtian Devotion. But Canonical penances being meerly of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Inſtitution, and pertaining to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline; it cannot be denied, but that the Church has Power to Intend, or Remit them, according to the different Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Time, Place and Perſons; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince Chriſt himſelf has given her Power to remit and retain Sins, in which Power this Relaxation is manifeſtly implied.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, the <hi>R. C. Church</hi> does not now impoſe ſuch rigorous Penances upon Sinners, as the primitive Church did. Nor does ſhe expoſe them publickly in the Church in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential Weeds,</hi> as was practic'd in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Times; but then the Reaſon on't is, becauſe no Body now wou'd undertake theſe Penances; becauſe ſhe is convinc'd, that Men wou'd ſooner break off with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and turn <hi>Heathens,</hi> than purchaſe Heaven at ſo dear a Rate: So far has Wickedneſs and Diſſolution prevail'd in the World!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="294" facs="tcp:103560:155"/>In the Infancy of the Church, Piety, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, Mortification, Auſterity were lovely Things: Chriſtians affected them very much of themſelves, and therefore readily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took them, when they had the misfortune to fall into any grievous Sin. Beſides, they had before their Eyes frequent Examples of the Conſtancy and Reſolution of their Paſtors. They ſaw them expoſe their Lives with the greateſt contempt of the World, and bear the Torments of <hi>Racks, Gridirons, Wheels,</hi> and other helliſh Inſtruments (Epiſcopacy in thoſe days being but one remove from <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom</hi>) with as much chearfulneſs, and as little concern, as if theſe cruel Engins had been <hi>Bays</hi> and <hi>Laurels;</hi> and therefore it is not to be admir'd, that the Blood of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> then reeking hot, ſhou'd warm their inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ſufferings and mortification; and ſtir them up to a contempt of the allurements and pleaſures of a wicked World; not knowing how ſoon they themſelves ſhou'd be call'd to the like <hi>Fiery Tryal.</hi> But no ſooner did the Blood of <hi>Martyrs</hi> grow cold, and the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Death were taken away, by the Peace and Quiet, which <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to the Church, when the Primitive Piety and Devotion began to decay, and Chriſtians multiplied their Sins, as they did their Riches. No ſooner were the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gninary Laws, and cruel Edicts of <hi>Pagan Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors</hi> repeal'd; and Chriſtians put in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of great Fortunes, and promoted to Honors and Dignities; when they forgot their former Condition, wax'd wanton a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:103560:155"/>
Chriſt, and ſpurn'd at Diſcipline. So that, in a few Ages after, you might as well expect <hi>Grapes</hi> from <hi>Thorns,</hi> or <hi>Figs</hi> from <hi>Thiſtles,</hi> as the primitive Penances from modern Chriſtians: And therefore it was neceſſary to mitigate the Severity of that Diſcipline, leſt the generality of (I may ſay all) Chriſtians ſhou'd throw off all care of their Salvation, and either return to Pagan Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or follow the Deluſions of their own Fancies.</p>
                  <p>However, ſince the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Biſhops (whoſe Conduct ought to be the Rule and Meaſure of all future Ages) have preſcrib'd, and declar'd what Penances ought to be impos'd upon Sinners, according to the degree of their Sins; the Church hath always taught, that all Chriſtians, who have been, or are ſo unfortunate as to fall into grievous Sins; are ſtill lyable to theſe Penan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, unleſs they are diſpens'd with by the Church, or <hi>Commuted</hi> for ſome other Works of Piety. And, that the diſcipline of the Church, might be preſerv'd and upheld, as much as the Wickedneſs of the Times will bear; all Paſtors and Confeſſors are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to impoſe ſuch Penances upon Sinners as will bear ſome proportion with the greatneſs of their Sins; tho' not to that degree as the primitive Canons require: Leaving the reſt to be diſpens'd with, or Indulg'd by the <hi>Chief Paſtors</hi> of the Church, according to the power which Chriſt has given them, and as general Councils have determin'd. And this, in as few Words as I cou'd well deliver
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:103560:156"/>
it, is truly and plainly the Caſe of <hi>Indulgences;</hi> and the reaſon, why they are ſo often given, is the great decay of Piety and Devotion in Chriſtians, and the tender affection of the Church for their eternal Welfare; not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Money, or any filthy Lucre, as our Adverſaries do moſt injuſtly ſuggeſt. On the contrary, I am confident that there is not one Divine or Caſuiſt in our Church, who does not hold, that it is Sinful and Diabolical, even the Sin of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> to give, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Money for <hi>Indulgences.</hi> And ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>General Councils</hi> and <hi>Pope's Decrees</hi> have expreſly declar'd that to give, or receive any ſort of Gift, either directly, or indirectly, for either Indulgences, or any other Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Grace is perfect <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:103560:156"/>
neither the Condition of the Perſons, nor the Wickedneſs of the Times, nor yet the great Decay of Piety will permit us to require they ſhou'd fully perform. And this we do; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we find the ſame thing practic'd in the beſt and pureſt Times of Chriſtianity, even in the <hi>Firſt, Second, Third</hi> and <hi>Fourth</hi> Ages; eſpecially, being warranted by the Word of God, who gave to his Church the Power of remitting and retaining Sins.</p>
                  <p>And now, having found nothing in Dr. <hi>Tillotſon's</hi> Sermons upon this Subject, that requires any particular Conſideration, beſides what is here explain'd; I ſhall conclude this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> with my Hearty Prayers to the <hi>Father of Light,</hi> that He wou'd be mercifully pleas'd to open the Eyes of our Adverſaries, that they may ſee the Innocence, and Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs of our Doctrine; and give them the <hi>Grace</hi> to lay ſeriouſly to Heart, how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous it is to reject thoſe Things, which the Catholic Church declares to have been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and His <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> Our, and Their <hi>Creed</hi> ſays; <hi>I believe the Holy Catholic Church:</hi> And they own, that the Catholic Church, before the <hi>Reformation,</hi> did hold and Declare thoſe Things, wherein we differ from them, to be Truths deliver'd by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and His <hi>Apoſtles:</hi> How then can they <hi>believe the Catholic Church,</hi> when She declares theſe Things, if they do not hold and believe theſe Things themſelves? Or how can they in Reaſon reject them, if they <hi>believe the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church,</hi> which tells them, they are Divine Truths?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="298" facs="tcp:103560:157"/>But there is yet ſomething more deſperate, which I beg of Almighty God to give them the <hi>Grace</hi> to conſider. Our Saviour ſaith to His Apoſtles: <hi>Go, and teach all Nations, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy-Ghoſt; teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you,</hi> Mat. c. 28.19, 20. And St. <hi>Mark</hi> adds: <hi>He that believeth, and is Baptiz'd, ſhall be Sav'd; but he that believeth not, ſhall be Damn'd,</hi> Cap. 16.16. Now if thoſe Things, which make the Subject of our Diſpute, be Truths given in charge to the Apoſtles, then our Adverſaries are (to my great grief I muſt ſay it) loſt for ever: For it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, according to Chriſt's own Words, to Believe in the <hi>Trinity,</hi> to Believe the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation,</hi> to believe in the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> to believe <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> &amp;c. But we muſt believe <hi>all Things whatſoever</hi> Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; and that on pain of Damnation. But if it ſhou'd happen (as no doubt it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not) that the Points in Diſpute, were not commanded by Chriſt or His Apoſtles; where is the harm in believing them, ſince we are commanded to do ſo by the Church, which our <hi>Creed</hi> tells us we muſt believe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſt</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi> doth often reproach the <hi>Jews</hi> for their Incredulity, and the Scripture, in ſeveral places, gives us an Account of the Puniſhment of ſuch as wou'd not believe the Meſſengers ſent by God to declare His Will to them: But we do not find, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver He reproach'd any Body for having too much Faith; eſpecially when the Things to

be believ'd, were declar'd to them, by the Meſſengers of God, which, ſure, the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> of the Church are: On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, we read in the Scripture, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> has, upon ſeveral Occaſions, highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and extoll'd Men's readineſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.

How can it hurt any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to believe that the Church hath Power to give <hi>Indulgences,</hi> that is, to Remit all, or part of the Temporal Puniſhment due for Sins; ſince it is plainly expreſt in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> that Chriſt gave to His <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to their Succeſſors, the Power of <hi>Remitting, and Retaining Sins;</hi> and that <hi>whatſoever they Looſe on Earth, ſhall be Looſed in Heaven?</hi> How can this hurt any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, I ſay, or where lies the Hazard in believing thoſe Things; tho' we had not as much aſſurance of their being Divine Truths, as of other Things; ſince they are

not contrary to any other <hi>Article</hi> of our <hi>Faith,</hi> nor to Right Reaſon, or Good Manners?
